Your task is to evaluate whether all bounding boxes for all targets in the images are correct.

Specifically, consider the following questions before making your judgment:
1. Does each bounding box perfectly enclose one single target object? 
2. Are all target objects localized by a bounding box?
3. Is each bounding box neither too loose nor too tight?

Before finalizing your evaluation, please consider the following suggestions:
1. For question 1 (Precision), if an object is occluded, the bounding box should be inferred based on a reasonable estimation of the object's size.
2. For question 2 (Recall), not all target objects should be in the image.
3. For question 3 (Fit), don't be too harsh when bounding box edges just slightly cut off the object or just enclose a little bit of the outside area.

All target objects that need to be labeled:
['articulated dump truck',
 'bulldozer',
 'combined piling and drilling rig',
 'crawler crane',
 'crawler excavator',
 'crawler loader',
 'duty cycle crane',
 'gantry crane',
 'log loader',
 'maritime crane',
 'material handling machine',
 'mining bulldozer',
 'mining excavator',
 'mining truck',
 'mobile crane',
 'pipelayer',
 'pontoon excavator',
 'reachstacker',
 'telescopic handler',
 'tower crane',
 'truck mixer',
 'wheel excavator',
 'wheel loader']
