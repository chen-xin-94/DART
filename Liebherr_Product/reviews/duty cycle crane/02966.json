Both cranes are well within their respective bounding boxes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible duty cycle cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes appropriately, with slight allowances for the edges.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
