                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box on the right each enclose one duty cycle crane. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify and enclose the target objects without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two duty cycle cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box on the right both seem to fit well around the duty cycle cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
