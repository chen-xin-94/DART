In the image, the purple and red bounding boxes each enclose one duty cycle crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two duty cycle cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple and red bounding boxes appear to fit well around the duty cycle cranes, with a reasonable margin that does not cut off significant parts of the cranes or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
