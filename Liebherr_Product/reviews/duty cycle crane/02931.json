The crane is fully within the bounding box, and no other objects are included.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one duty cycle crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the crane, including its extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
