The excavator is not occluded, so the bounding box is accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no mining trucks in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
