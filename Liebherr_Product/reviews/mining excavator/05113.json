The mining excavator's bounding box is well-placed, and the mining truck's bounding box also accurately encloses the truck.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor acceptable deviations.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
