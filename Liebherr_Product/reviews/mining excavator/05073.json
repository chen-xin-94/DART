It includes the entire excavator without cutting off any significant parts.\n   - The bounding box for the \"mining truck\" is also well-fitted, enclosing the entire truck without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
