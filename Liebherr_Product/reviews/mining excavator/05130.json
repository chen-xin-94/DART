The box is well-placed around the excavator, even though part of the excavator is occluded by the rock. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the excavator.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that need to be annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, with slight allowances for occlusion and the overall shape of the excavator.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
