This is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There is one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n   - There is no mining truck in the image, so the recall for mining trucks is not applicable.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box for the mining excavator is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck is irrelevant as it does not enclose a mining truck.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box for the mining truck is incorrect.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because the mining excavator is correctly localized, and there is no mining truck to be localized.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding box for the mining excavator is well-fitted.",
