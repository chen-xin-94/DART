The mining excavator's bounding box is well-placed, and the mining truck's bounding box also accurately encloses the truck.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The mining excavator's bounding box slightly cuts off the bottom part of the excavator, but this is acceptable. The mining truck's bounding box is well-fitted.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
