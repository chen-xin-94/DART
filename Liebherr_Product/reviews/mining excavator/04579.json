There is no overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining excavator, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that need to be annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining excavator without cutting off significant parts of it or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
