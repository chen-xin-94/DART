The excavator is well-defined within the box, even though parts of it are occluded by the terrain.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire excavator, including the arm and bucket, without cutting off significant parts of the object or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
