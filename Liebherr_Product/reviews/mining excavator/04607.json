Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains a mining excavator and a mining truck. However, only the mining excavator is annotated, and the mining truck is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the mining truck and some background. It could be tighter to better fit the mining excavator.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
