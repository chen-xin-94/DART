The mining excavator and the mining truck are both individually enclosed by their respective bounding boxes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible target objects (one mining excavator and one mining truck) are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the objects without significant parts being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
