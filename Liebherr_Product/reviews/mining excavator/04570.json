There are no other objects within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no mining trucks present in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the entire mining excavator without cutting off any parts or including unnecessary background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
