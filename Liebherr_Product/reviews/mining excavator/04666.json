The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire machine, and the mining truck's bounding box also includes the entire truck. There is no significant part of either object outside the bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the objects well without cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
