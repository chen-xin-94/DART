The mining truck is not included in the bounding box, which is correct.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining excavator, and it is localized by a bounding box. There is no requirement for a mining truck to be annotated if it is not the target object.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining excavator, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
