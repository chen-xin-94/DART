The mining excavator and the mining truck are both correctly enclosed within their respective bounding boxes. The boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are annotated, and there are no other mining excavators or trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the objects, with only slight cut-offs that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
