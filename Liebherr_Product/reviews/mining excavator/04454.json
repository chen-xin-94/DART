Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose the target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is a mining excavator in the image that is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the mining truck is reasonably well-fitted, but since it is incorrectly labeled, this criterion is not met.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
