It includes the entire excavator without cutting off significant parts.\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck is also well-fitted, enclosing the truck without being too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
