The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire excavator, and the mining truck's bounding box includes the entire truck.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the objects well without significant portions being cut off or excessive empty space around them.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
