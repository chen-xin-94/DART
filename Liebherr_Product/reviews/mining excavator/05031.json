The bounding box for the mining truck also encloses the truck without including other objects. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single target objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the respective objects, with only minor acceptable deviations.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
