The mining excavator is fully enclosed within the purple bounding box, and the mining truck is fully enclosed within the red bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the objects well without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
