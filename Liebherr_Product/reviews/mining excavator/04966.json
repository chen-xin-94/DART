The mining excavator's bounding box is well-placed, and the mining truck's bounding box also accurately encloses the truck.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the respective objects, with only minor acceptable deviations.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
