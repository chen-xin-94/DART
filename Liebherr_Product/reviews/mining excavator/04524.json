Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains both a mining excavator and a mining truck, but only one bounding box is present. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the combined objects, but since it should enclose only one object, this criterion is not applicable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
