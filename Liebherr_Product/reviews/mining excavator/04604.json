The mining excavator is fully enclosed within the purple bounding box, and the mining truck is fully enclosed within the red bounding box. There is no significant part of either object outside their respective bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The edges of the bounding boxes slightly cut off the objects, but this is within acceptable limits. The bounding boxes provide a good fit for the objects.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
