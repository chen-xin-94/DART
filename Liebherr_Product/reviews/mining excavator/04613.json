The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire machine, and the mining truck's bounding box also seems to cover the truck well. There is no significant overlap or inclusion of other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other visible mining excavators or trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects potentially being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
