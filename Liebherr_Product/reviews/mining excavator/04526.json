Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around their respective objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, even considering the occlusion and partial visibility of the mining truck.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
