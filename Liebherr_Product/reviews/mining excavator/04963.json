The box is well-placed around the excavator, even though part of the excavator is occluded by the truck.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining excavator, and it is localized by a bounding box. There is no requirement for a mining truck to be present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, with a reasonable margin.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
