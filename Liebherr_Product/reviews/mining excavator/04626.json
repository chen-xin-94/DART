The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire excavator, and the mining truck's bounding box includes the entire truck. There is no significant part of any other object within these bounding boxes.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects potentially being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
