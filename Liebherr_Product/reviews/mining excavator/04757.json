The mining excavator and the mining truck are each enclosed by their respective bounding boxes without including other objects. The bounding boxes are correctly placed around the target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is one mining excavator and one mining truck in the image, and both are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the mining excavator and the mining truck, with a reasonable margin that does not cut off significant parts of the objects or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
