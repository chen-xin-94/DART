Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains both a mining excavator and a mining truck, but only the mining excavator is annotated. The mining truck is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the mining excavator, but it includes the mining truck as well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
