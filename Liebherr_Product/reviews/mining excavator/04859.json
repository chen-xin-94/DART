The mining excavator is fully enclosed, and the mining truck is also well enclosed. There is no significant overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by a bounding box. There are no other visible mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the objects well without cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
