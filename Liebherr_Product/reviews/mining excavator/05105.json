The mining excavator and the mining truck are both correctly enclosed within their respective bounding boxes. The boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They accurately enclose the objects without significant portions being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
