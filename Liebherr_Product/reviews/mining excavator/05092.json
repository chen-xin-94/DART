The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire machine, and the mining truck's bounding box includes the entire truck. There is no significant part of either object outside the bounding boxes.\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
