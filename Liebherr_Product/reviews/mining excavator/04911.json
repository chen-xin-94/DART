The mining excavator and the mining truck are both individually enclosed without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible target objects (one mining excavator and one mining truck) are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor acceptable deviations.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
