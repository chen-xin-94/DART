The bounding box for the mining truck and the mining excavator both enclose their respective objects without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects in the image should be localized by a bounding box. Both the mining truck and the mining excavator are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes for both the mining truck and the mining excavator are well-fitted, not cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
