There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is correctly placed around the excavator.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that need to be annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the mining excavator, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
