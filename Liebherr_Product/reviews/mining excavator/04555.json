The mining truck in the background is not included in this bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. The mining truck in the background is not annotated, but the task specifies that not all target objects need to be present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining excavator, including its arm and body.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
