It does not include any other objects.\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck (red) encloses the entire truck, including the wheels and the body. It does not include any other objects.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There is one mining excavator and one mining truck in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n   - All target objects in the image are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box for the mining excavator is slightly loose, especially around the arm area, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck is well-fitted, with a slight margin around the edges.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
