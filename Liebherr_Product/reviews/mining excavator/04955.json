There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is reasonably inferred even if parts of the excavator are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no mining trucks in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, with only slight cutting off or enclosing of the outside area, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
