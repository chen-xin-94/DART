The bounding box for the mining truck also perfectly encloses the truck without including other objects. Therefore, each bounding box encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the respective objects, with only slight cutting off or inclusion of outside areas, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
