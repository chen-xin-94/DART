The mining excavator is fully enclosed within the purple bounding box, and the mining truck is fully enclosed within the red bounding box. There is no significant overlap or inclusion of other objects within these bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box for the mining excavator and the red bounding box for the mining truck both fit well around their respective objects, with only minimal and acceptable cut-off or inclusion of surrounding areas.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
