In this image, the red bounding box encloses a mining truck, and the purple bounding box encloses a mining excavator. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose their respective objects without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is one mining truck and one mining excavator, both of which are correctly localized by their respective bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box around the mining truck and the purple bounding box around the mining excavator both fit well, enclosing the objects without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
