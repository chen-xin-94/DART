Both boxes are correctly identifying single target objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They appropriately enclose the target objects without significant portions being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
