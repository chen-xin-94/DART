The bounding box for the mining truck also encloses the truck accurately without including other objects. Therefore, each bounding box encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire excavator, and the mining truck's bounding box includes the entire truck. The edges of the bounding boxes do not cut off significant parts of the objects or include excessive outside areas.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
