The mining excavator is fully enclosed within the red bounding box, and the mining truck is fully enclosed within the purple bounding box. There is no significant part of either object outside their respective bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects potentially being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
