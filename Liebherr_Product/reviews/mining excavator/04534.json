                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes for both the mining excavator and the mining truck seem to perfectly enclose each target object without including other objects. The mining excavator's bounding box is well-placed, covering the entire excavator. The mining truck's bounding box also accurately encloses the truck.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining excavators or trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
