The entire excavator is within the box, and no other objects are included.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
