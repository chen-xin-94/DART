The bounding box for the mining truck also correctly encloses the truck. Therefore, each bounding box encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the respective objects.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
