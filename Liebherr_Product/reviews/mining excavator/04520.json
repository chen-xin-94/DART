Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single target objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
