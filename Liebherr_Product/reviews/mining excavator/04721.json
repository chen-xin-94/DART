The box is drawn around the entire excavator, even though parts of it are occluded or not fully visible.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining excavator, and it is localized by a bounding box. There is no mining truck in the image, but that is acceptable as per the instructions.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.",
