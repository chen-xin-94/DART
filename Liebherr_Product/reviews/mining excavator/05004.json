Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is correctly localized. However, there is also a mining truck partially visible in the image that is not annotated. Therefore, the answer is \"No\".\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight; it fits well around the mining excavator. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".",
