In this image, the bounding boxes for the mining excavators and the mining truck seem to correctly enclose the respective objects without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mining excavators and one mining truck, all of which are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is good.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes for the mining excavators and the mining truck appear to be well-fitted, not cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
