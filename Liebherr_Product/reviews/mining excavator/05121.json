The bounding box for the mining excavator does enclose the entire excavator, and the bounding box for the mining truck does enclose the entire truck. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying their respective objects without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is one mining excavator and one mining truck, both of which are correctly localized by their respective bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box for the mining excavator is slightly loose but acceptable, and the bounding box for the mining truck is also slightly loose but acceptable. Both bounding boxes fit their respective objects reasonably well.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
