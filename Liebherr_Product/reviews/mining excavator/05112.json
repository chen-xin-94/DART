The mining excavator and the mining truck are both individually enclosed by their respective bounding boxes. The boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the objects well, with only minor parts of the objects slightly cut off or a small amount of background included, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
