The mining excavator and the mining truck are both enclosed within their respective bounding boxes. The boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects being cut off or slightly enclosing the outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
