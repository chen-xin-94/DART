There is no other object within the bounding box, and it accurately captures the entire excavator, including the arm and bucket.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, capturing the entire object without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
