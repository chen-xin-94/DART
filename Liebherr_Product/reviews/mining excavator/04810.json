The box is well-placed around the excavator, even though part of it is occluded by the truck.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is correctly localized by the bounding box. There is no mining truck annotated, but the task only requires the mining excavator to be annotated if present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, even though the excavator is partially occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
