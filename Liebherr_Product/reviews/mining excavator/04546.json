The bounding box for the mining truck also perfectly encloses the truck. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying one single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the objects well without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
