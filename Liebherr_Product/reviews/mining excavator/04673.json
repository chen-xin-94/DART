It only covers a portion of the excavator, missing significant parts of it.\n2. **Recall:** Not all target objects (mining excavators and mining trucks) are localized by a bounding box. There is only one bounding box present, and it does not cover the entire mining excavator.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mining excavator. It misses significant parts of the excavator, such as the tracks and the rear section.",
