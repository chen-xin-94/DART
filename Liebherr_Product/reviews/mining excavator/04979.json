The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire machine, and the mining truck's bounding box also encloses the entire truck without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining excavator and mining truck) present in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects potentially being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
