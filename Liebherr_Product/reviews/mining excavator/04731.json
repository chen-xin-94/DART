There is no overlap with other objects, and the entire excavator is within the box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining excavators or mining trucks in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, with no significant parts of the excavator being cut off or excessive empty space within the box.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
