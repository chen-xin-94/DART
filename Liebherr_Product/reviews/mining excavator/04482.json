However, there is another mining excavator in the background that is not annotated. The bounding box does not perfectly enclose the entire object, as it cuts off part of the excavator's arm.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is another mining excavator in the background that is not annotated. Additionally, there is a mining truck in the image that is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly too tight, cutting off part of the excavator's arm. It should be adjusted to fully enclose the entire object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: The bounding box does not perfectly enclose the entire mining excavator.\n- **Recall**: Not all target objects (mining excavators and mining trucks) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight, cutting off part of the excavator's arm.",
