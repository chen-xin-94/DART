The bounding box for the mining truck (red) does not perfectly enclose the truck; it only captures a part of it.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the mining excavator is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding box for the mining truck is too tight as it only captures a part of the truck.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
