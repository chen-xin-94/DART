The box is well-placed around the excavator, even though parts of it are occluded by the terrain.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no mining trucks present in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining excavator, considering the occlusion by the terrain.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
