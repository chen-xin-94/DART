The mining excavator's bounding box includes the entire machine, and the mining truck's bounding box also encloses the truck properly. There is no significant part of any other object within these bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining excavator and the mining truck present in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining excavators or mining trucks in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The mining excavator's bounding box fits well around the machine, and the mining truck's bounding box also fits well around the truck. The edges of the bounding boxes do not cut off significant parts of the objects, nor do they include excessive outside areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
