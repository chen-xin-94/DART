Both bounding boxes accurately enclose one mining excavator each without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. Both mining excavators in the image are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the mining excavators, with only slight cut-offs that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
