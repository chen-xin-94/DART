The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even though parts of the excavators are occluded by debris and the building structure.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler excavators in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler excavators that are missed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the crawler excavators well, with only minor parts of the machinery slightly outside the boxes, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
