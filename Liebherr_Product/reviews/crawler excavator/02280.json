The box is well-placed around the excavator, even though some parts of the excavator are occluded by vegetation. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the excavator.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the excavator, considering the occlusion by vegetation.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
