The red bounding box encloses the left crawler excavator, and the purple bounding box encloses the right crawler excavator. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler excavators, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left crawler excavator is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the object. The purple bounding box on the right crawler excavator is also slightly loose but acceptable. Both bounding boxes fit the objects well enough without significant issues.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
