The bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler excavators, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted around the crawler excavators. They do not cut off significant parts of the excavators and do not include excessive background.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
