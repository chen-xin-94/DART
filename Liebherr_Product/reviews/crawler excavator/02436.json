The entire excavator, including its extended arm, is within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire excavator, including the extended arm, without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
