The arm of the excavator is partially occluded by the mist, but the bounding box reasonably estimates its size.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler excavator, including the main body and the tracks, without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
