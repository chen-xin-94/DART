However, it does not enclose the entire crawler excavator.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (crawler excavators) are localized by a bounding box. The bounding box only covers the bucket part of one crawler excavator.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it only covers the bucket and not the entire crawler excavator.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
