The red bounding box encloses the upper crawler excavator, and the purple bounding box encloses the lower crawler excavator. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (crawler excavators) in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler excavators, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the crawler excavators well without cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
