Although the arm of the excavator extends beyond the box, the main body and a significant portion of the arm are within the box. This is acceptable given the context.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially around the arm of the excavator, but it is not excessively so. It captures the main body and a significant portion of the arm, which is reasonable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
