It seems to be focused on a small part of the scene, possibly a different object or a very small part of the excavator.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one crawler excavator in the image that is not localized by a bounding box. The large excavator in the middle of the image is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fit the crawler excavator properly. It is too small and does not cover the entire object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
