The bounding box on the right also encloses a material handling machine, but it is partially occluded by the fence. However, the bounding box is reasonably estimated. Therefore, both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: All visible material handling machines in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the material handling machines, even considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
