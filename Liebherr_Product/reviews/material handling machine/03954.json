The arm and the base of the machine are within the box, and the occlusion by the pile of material is reasonably accounted for.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one material handling machine in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some background elements, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably fits the material handling machine.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
