The red bounding box includes parts of the background and is too loose, while the purple bounding box is more accurate but still includes some background.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two material handling machines, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose, including a significant portion of the background. The purple bounding box is a better fit but still includes some background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
