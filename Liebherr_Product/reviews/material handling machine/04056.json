The box is drawn around the machine, including its arm and body. \n2. **Recall**: There is only one material handling machine visible in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially around the arm of the machine. However, it is not excessively loose and does not cut off any part of the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
