The box does not include any other objects and is reasonably inferred for the occluded parts.\n2. **Recall**: There are two material handling machines in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the material handling machine.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
