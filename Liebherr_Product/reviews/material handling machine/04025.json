The machine is well-defined within the box, even though part of it is occluded by the wall.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one material handling machine in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the material handling machine, even accounting for the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
