However, it also includes a significant portion of the background and other objects, which reduces precision.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one material handling machine in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area, which is not part of the material handling machine.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
