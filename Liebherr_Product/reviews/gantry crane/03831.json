It includes parts of the surrounding area and other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Not all gantry cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple gantry cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the surrounding area and other objects, not just the gantry crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
