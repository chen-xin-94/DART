It appears to be too loose and includes parts of the ship and other structures.\n2. **Recall**: Not all gantry cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple gantry cranes visible in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, as it includes parts of the ship and other structures, not just the gantry crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
