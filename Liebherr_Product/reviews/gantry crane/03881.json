However, there are multiple gantry cranes in the image that are not enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect as it does not account for all gantry cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all gantry cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are several gantry cranes visible in the background that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated gantry crane appears to be well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the gantry crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
