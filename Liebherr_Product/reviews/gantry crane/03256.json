In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the gantry cranes accurately without including other objects. The occlusion is minimal and does not affect the precision significantly.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three gantry cranes visible in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the gantry cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
