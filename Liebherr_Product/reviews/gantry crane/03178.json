The purple bounding box also encloses one gantry crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two gantry cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the gantry crane, and the purple bounding box also fits well around the other gantry crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
