It appears to cover multiple cranes or parts of multiple cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all gantry cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are several gantry cranes visible in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple cranes or parts of multiple cranes, rather than fitting snugly around a single gantry crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
