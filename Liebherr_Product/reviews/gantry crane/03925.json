In this image, the purple bounding box on the left correctly encloses a single gantry crane. However, the red bounding box in the middle is too tight and does not fully enclose the gantry crane. The purple bounding box on the right is also correct. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible gantry cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding boxes on the left and right are well-fitted. However, the red bounding box in the middle is too tight and does not fully enclose the gantry crane.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
