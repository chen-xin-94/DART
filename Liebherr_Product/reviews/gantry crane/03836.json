Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple gantry cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the ship and other objects. It should be tighter around the gantry crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
