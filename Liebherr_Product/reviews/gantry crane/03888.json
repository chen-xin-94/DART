The box does not include any other objects and is well-aligned with the gantry crane's structure.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple gantry cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is well-fitted to the gantry crane. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably estimates the size of the object even if parts are occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
