However, it also includes a person, which means it does not perfectly enclose just the wheel loader.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (wheel loaders) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are two wheel loaders in the image. The one on the right is enclosed by a bounding box, but the one in the background on the left is not enclosed by any bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box around the wheel loader on the right is too loose as it includes a person and part of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box includes a person along with the wheel loader.\n- **Recall**: No, because the wheel loader in the background is not annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding box is too loose and includes extra elements.",
