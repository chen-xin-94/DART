In this image, the bounding boxes correctly enclose the wheel loaders without including other objects. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the wheel loaders are occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the wheel loaders, not cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
