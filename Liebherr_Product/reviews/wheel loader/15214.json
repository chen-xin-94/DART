It includes parts of the wheel loader in the background, but it also cuts off parts of the wheel loader in the foreground.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the background and does not fully enclose the wheel loader in the foreground.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
