In this image, the purple bounding box on the left correctly encloses the wheel loader. The red bounding box on the right also correctly encloses the wheel loader. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual wheel loaders.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left is slightly loose but still acceptable. The red bounding box on the right is also slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
