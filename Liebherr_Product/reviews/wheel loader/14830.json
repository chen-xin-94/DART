The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by another object. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
