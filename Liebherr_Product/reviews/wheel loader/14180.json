In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"wheel loader.\" The purple bounding box on the left correctly encloses a wheel loader. The red bounding box on the right also correctly encloses another wheel loader. Both bounding boxes accurately enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left fits well around the wheel loader, and the red bounding box on the right also fits well around the other wheel loader. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
