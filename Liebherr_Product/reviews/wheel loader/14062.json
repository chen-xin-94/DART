The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by rocks, the bounding box reasonably estimates the size of the loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
