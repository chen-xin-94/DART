The blue bounding box encloses a wheel loader, but it also includes some background elements, making it slightly imprecise. The black bounding box also encloses a wheel loader but includes some background elements as well. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The blue bounding box is a bit loose as it includes some background elements. The black bounding box is also a bit loose for the same reason. However, they are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
