The red bounding box encloses the wheel loader in the background, and the purple bounding box encloses the wheel loader in the foreground. Both bounding boxes are reasonably accurate, even though the red bounding box includes some background elements due to occlusion.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible wheel loaders in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box includes some background elements, but this is acceptable given the occlusion. The purple bounding box fits well around the wheel loader in the foreground.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
