The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by dirt. The occlusion is minimal and the bounding box is inferred correctly.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with slight tolerance for the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
