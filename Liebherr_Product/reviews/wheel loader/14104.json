There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is drawn around the entire wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the wheel loader, with no significant parts of the loader being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
