The smaller bounding box in the inset also encloses a wheel loader accurately.\n   - Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single wheel loader each.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The larger bounding box fits well around the wheel loader, not cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n   - The smaller bounding box in the inset also fits well around the wheel loader.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
