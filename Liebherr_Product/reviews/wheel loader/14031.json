In this image, the bounding box with the label \"wheel loader 0.54\" does not perfectly enclose a single wheel loader; it includes parts of another wheel loader and some background. The bounding box with the label \"wheel loader 0.61\" also does not perfectly enclose a single wheel loader; it includes parts of the background and is too loose.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box with the label \"wheel loader 0.54\" is too loose and includes parts of another wheel loader and some background. The bounding box with the label \"wheel loader 0.61\" is also too loose and includes parts of the background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
