The box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire wheel loader without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
