In this image, the bounding box encloses both the wheel loader and part of the truck. This means the bounding box does not perfectly enclose just the wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one wheel loader, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the truck and some surrounding area, which is not part of the wheel loader.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
