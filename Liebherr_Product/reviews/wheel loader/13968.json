It seems to be a bit loose but still reasonably encloses the object.\n   - The purple bounding box also encloses one wheel loader. It is slightly tight but still reasonably encloses the object.\n   - Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose but acceptable.\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly tight but acceptable.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
