The bounding boxes do not include any other objects and are reasonably inferred for occluded parts.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the wheel loaders, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs, which are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
