The red bounding box encloses the wheel loader on the left, and the purple bounding box encloses the wheel loader on the right. Both bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even though parts of the wheel loaders are occluded by rocks.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both wheel loaders in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional wheel loaders in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the wheel loaders well, with only minor parts of the objects slightly cut off or a small amount of background included, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
