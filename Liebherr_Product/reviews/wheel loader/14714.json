The box is drawn around the entire wheel loader, including the parts that are visible and reasonably estimating the occluded parts.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It encloses the wheel loader well, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
