It includes parts of another object (a conveyor belt or similar machinery) along with the wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: There are two wheel loaders in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of another object and does not tightly fit the wheel loader.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
