In this image, the red bounding box on the left encloses a wheel loader, the purple bounding box in the middle encloses another wheel loader, and the blue bounding box on the right encloses a third wheel loader. Each bounding box correctly encloses one wheel loader without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three wheel loaders in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box in the middle fit well around the wheel loaders. The blue bounding box on the right also fits well around the wheel loader.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
