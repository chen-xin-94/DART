The box is drawn around the entire wheel loader, even though part of it is occluded by the arm of the loader. This is acceptable as the bounding box is inferred based on a reasonable estimation of the object's size.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
