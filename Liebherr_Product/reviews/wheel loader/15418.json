It seems to cover the entire wheel loader, including the wheels and the loader arm.\n   - The purple bounding box encloses the wheel loader on the right side. It also seems to cover the entire wheel loader, including the wheels and the loader arm.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the wheel loader, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - The purple bounding box is also slightly loose, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too tight nor too loose to a significant degree.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
