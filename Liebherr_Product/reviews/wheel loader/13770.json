It includes parts of the wheel loader on the left and the wheel loader on the right. Therefore, the precision is not correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains two wheel loaders, but only one bounding box is present. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of two wheel loaders and some background area. It does not fit well around a single wheel loader.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
