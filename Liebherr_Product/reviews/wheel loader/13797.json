The annotations are clear and each box contains one wheel loader without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible wheel loaders in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are three wheel loaders and each one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the wheel loaders. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably estimate the size of the wheel loaders, even if some parts are occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
