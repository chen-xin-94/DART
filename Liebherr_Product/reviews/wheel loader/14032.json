                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose one wheel loader each. The bounding box for the wheel loader in the foreground (purple) is well-placed, and the bounding box for the wheel loader in the background (red) is also correctly placed, even though the object is partially occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box for the wheel loader in the foreground (purple) is well-fitted, and the bounding box for the wheel loader in the background (red) is also reasonably fitted, considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
