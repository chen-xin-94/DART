It includes parts of the truck and the background, which means it is not precise.\n2. **Recall**: There are two wheel loaders in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the truck and the background, which means it does not fit the wheel loader well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
