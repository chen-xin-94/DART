Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (wheel loaders) are localized by the bounding box, so recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes more than one wheel loader and a significant amount of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
