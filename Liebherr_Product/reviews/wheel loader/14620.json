The box includes the entire wheel loader, even though part of it is occluded by the pile of waste. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the wheel loader accurately without cutting off significant parts or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
