However, the bounding box still reasonably estimates the size of the occluded wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: All visible wheel loaders in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the wheel loaders, even considering the slight occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
