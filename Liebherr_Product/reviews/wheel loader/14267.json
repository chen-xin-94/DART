In this image, the bounding box does enclose the wheel loader accurately, without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is only one wheel loader, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box fits well around the wheel loader, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
