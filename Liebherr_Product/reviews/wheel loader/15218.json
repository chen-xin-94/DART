Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - Both wheel loaders in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no wheel loaders left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding box for the wheel loader in the foreground (label \"wheel loader 0.75\") is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box for the wheel loader in the background (label \"wheel loader 0.53\") is also well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
