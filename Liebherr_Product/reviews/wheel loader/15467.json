Therefore, it is not possible to determine if each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Since there are no bounding boxes present, it is clear that not all target objects (wheel loaders) are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Without any bounding boxes, it is impossible to evaluate whether the fit is appropriate.\n\nGiven these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No bounding boxes are present, so we cannot confirm if they perfectly enclose the target objects.\n- **Recall**: No bounding boxes are present, so not all target objects are localized.\n- **Fit**: Without bounding boxes, we cannot assess the fit.",
