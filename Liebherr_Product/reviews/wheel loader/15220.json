The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both wheel loaders are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted around the wheel loaders, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
