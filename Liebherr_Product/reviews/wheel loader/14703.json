The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated even if parts of the wheel loaders are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: All visible wheel loaders in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the wheel loaders well without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
