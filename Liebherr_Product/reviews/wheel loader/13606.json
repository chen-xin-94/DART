The red bounding box (wheel loader 0.61) correctly encloses the wheel loader in the background. The purple bounding box (wheel loader 0.68) correctly encloses the wheel loader in the foreground. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single wheel loaders.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. Both wheel loaders in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose but acceptable. The purple bounding box is slightly tight on the left side but still acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
