The larger wheel loader in the foreground is well enclosed by the red bounding box, and the smaller wheel loader in the background is also well enclosed by the purple bounding box. Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (wheel loaders) in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box around the larger wheel loader in the foreground fits well, and the purple bounding box around the smaller wheel loader in the background also fits well.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON format response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
