The purple bounding box on the right also encloses the wheel loader accurately. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual wheel loaders.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose but still acceptable. The purple bounding box on the right is well-fitted to the wheel loader.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
