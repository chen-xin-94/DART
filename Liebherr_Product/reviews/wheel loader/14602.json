The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by the arm. The occlusion is handled well by the bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
