The smaller wheel loader in the background is also correctly enclosed by the red bounding box. Both bounding boxes enclose only one wheel loader each.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (wheel loaders) in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box around the larger wheel loader fits well, and the red bounding box around the smaller wheel loader also fits well.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
