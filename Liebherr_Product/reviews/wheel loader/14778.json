The box is drawn around the entire wheel loader, including the wheels and the loader arm, which is appropriate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire wheel loader, including the loader arm, without cutting off any significant parts of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
