                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the bounding box on the left partially encloses a wheel loader but also includes part of the background. The bounding box on the right correctly encloses a single wheel loader. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left is too loose as it includes part of the background. The bounding box on the right fits well around the wheel loader. Therefore, the fit is not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
