The box is well-placed around the visible parts of the wheel loader on the left side of the image.\n2. **Recall**: There are two wheel loaders in the image, but only one is annotated. The wheel loader on the right side of the image is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader on the left side of the image.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
