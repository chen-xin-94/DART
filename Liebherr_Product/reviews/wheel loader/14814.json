                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, both bounding boxes enclose one wheel loader each. The bounding box for the wheel loader in the foreground (purple) is well-placed, and the bounding box for the wheel loader in the background (red) is also well-placed, even though the wheel loader is partially occluded by the rock pile. The occlusion is handled reasonably.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box for the wheel loader in the foreground (purple) fits well, with a slight margin around the loader. The bounding box for the wheel loader in the background (red) also fits well, considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
