There are two wheel loaders, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The red bounding box fits well around the wheel loader, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose as it includes the text label, but it still reasonably encloses the wheel loader.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the purple bounding box includes the text label which is not part of the wheel loader.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all wheel loaders in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the purple bounding box is slightly loose due to including the text label.",
