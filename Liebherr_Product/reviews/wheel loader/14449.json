The box is drawn around the entire wheel loader, even though part of it is occluded by the building. The occlusion is handled well, and the bounding box is inferred correctly.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs, which are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
