This reduces the precision as the bounding box should ideally only include the wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the truck. It should be adjusted to fit the wheel loader more precisely.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
