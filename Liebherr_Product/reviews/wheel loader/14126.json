The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by the pallet it is carrying. The occlusion is minimal and the bounding box is inferred correctly.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, including the parts that are visible and reasonably estimating the occluded parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
