The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by the person standing next to it. The occlusion is minimal and does not affect the overall precision of the bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is correctly localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with slight allowances for the occluded parts and minor external areas, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
