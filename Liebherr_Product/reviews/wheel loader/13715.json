Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one wheel loader each without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel loaders in the image, and both are annotated with bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the wheel loaders, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
