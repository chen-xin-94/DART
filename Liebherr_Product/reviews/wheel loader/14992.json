There are no additional wheel loaders that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box labeled \"wheel loader 0.52\" (red) is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the wheel loader in the background.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"wheel loader 0.65\" (purple) is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the wheel loader in the foreground.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
