The bounding boxes do not include parts of other objects or significant background areas. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three wheel loaders, but only two are annotated with bounding boxes. The wheel loader in the middle is not annotated. Therefore, the recall is not correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the wheel loaders well, with only minor parts of the objects being cut off or minor background areas included. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
