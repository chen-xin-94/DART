The box is reasonably inferred for the occluded parts.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, with only minor parts of the loader slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
