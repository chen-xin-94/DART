The occlusion of the wheel loader in the background is reasonably estimated.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both wheel loaders are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted to the wheel loaders, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
