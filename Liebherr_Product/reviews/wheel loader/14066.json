The box does not include any other objects and is well-aligned with the shape of the wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It slightly cuts off the edges of the wheel loader but this is acceptable and does not significantly affect the annotation quality.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
