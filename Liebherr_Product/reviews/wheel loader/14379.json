The box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is well-fitted around the wheel loader. It is neither too loose nor too tight, even considering the occlusion by snow.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
