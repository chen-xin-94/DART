In this image, the red bounding box correctly encloses the wheel loader in the foreground. The purple bounding box correctly encloses the wheel loader in the background. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual wheel loaders.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel loaders, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the wheel loader. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the wheel loader in the background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
