In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual wheel loaders without including other objects. The occlusion of the wheel loader in the background is reasonably estimated.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both visible wheel loaders are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image fit well around the wheel loaders, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
