Although part of the wheel loader is occluded by the haystack, the bounding box reasonably estimates the size of the wheel loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially on the right side where it includes part of the haystack. However, it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
