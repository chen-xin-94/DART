The box is well-placed around the wheel loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by the pile of scrap metal in the background. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the wheel loader, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
