The crane's arm and base are within the box, even though the arm is very long and extends vertically. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top where there is extra space above the crane's arm. However, it is not excessively loose, and the main parts of the crane are well enclosed.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
