However, there are multiple mobile cranes in the image that are not enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are at least two other mobile cranes visible in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated mobile crane is reasonably well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
