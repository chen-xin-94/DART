It is too small and does not cover the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains at least one mobile crane, but the bounding box does not accurately localize it. Therefore, the recall is not satisfactory.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fit the mobile crane properly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
