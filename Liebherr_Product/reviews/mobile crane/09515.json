In this image, the red bounding box on the left does not perfectly enclose the mobile crane; it includes part of the background and misses part of the crane. The purple bounding box on the right does enclose a single mobile crane accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left is too loose as it includes part of the background and misses part of the crane. The purple bounding box on the right fits well around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
