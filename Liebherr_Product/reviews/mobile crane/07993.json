The bounding box seems to cover the entire mobile crane, including its base and the extended arm. \n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (mobile cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - In the image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is enclosed by a bounding box. \n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box appears to fit well around the mobile crane, covering its entire structure without being excessively loose or cutting off significant parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: The bounding box perfectly encloses the mobile crane.\n- **Recall**: All mobile cranes (in this case, one) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: The bounding box is appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.",
