The crane is quite large and the bounding box seems to cover the entire structure, including the extended arm. Therefore, the precision is good.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Hence, recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It covers the entire crane, including the extended arm, without cutting off any significant parts of the crane or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
