The box does not include any other objects and is focused on one mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated with a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits the mobile crane well. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably estimates the size of the crane, even if parts are occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
