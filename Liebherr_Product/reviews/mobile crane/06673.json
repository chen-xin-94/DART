The red bounding box encloses the red mobile crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the yellow mobile crane. There is no significant part of any other object within these bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it still reasonably encloses the red mobile crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose at the top, but it reasonably encloses the yellow mobile crane. Both bounding boxes fit well enough to be considered correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
