It appears to be correctly placed around the crane, including the extended arm.\n   - The second bounding box (red) also encloses a mobile crane. It is correctly placed around the crane, including the extended arm.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose but reasonably fits the mobile crane.\n   - The red bounding box is slightly tight but reasonably fits the mobile crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
