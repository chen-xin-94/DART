                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the purple bounding box encloses one mobile crane, and the red bounding box encloses another mobile crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the structure next to the mobile crane, but it is reasonable. The red bounding box fits well around the second mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
