In this image, the left bounding box correctly encloses a mobile crane, and the right bounding box also correctly encloses another mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, and the right bounding box also fits well around the mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
