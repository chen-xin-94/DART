It includes a significant portion of the background and misses part of the crane's base. The left bounding box (with the label \"mobile crane 0.78\") is more accurate but still includes some background. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mobile cranes that are missed.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left is reasonably well-fitted, though it includes some background. The bounding box on the right is too loose, including a lot of background and missing part of the crane's base.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
