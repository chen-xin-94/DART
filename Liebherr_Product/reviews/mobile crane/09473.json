The box is drawn around the entire crane, including the extended arm and the base, which is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, including all parts of the crane without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
