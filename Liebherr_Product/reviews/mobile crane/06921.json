There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the mobile cranes well, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
