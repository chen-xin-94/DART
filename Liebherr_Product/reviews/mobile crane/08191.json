The purple bounding box also encloses a single mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it is acceptable. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
