There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.69\" (red) is neither too loose nor too tight; it fits well around the mobile crane.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.71\" (purple) is also well-fitted around the mobile crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
