It seems to be enclosing a part of the scene that includes multiple objects, not just a single mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There might be more mobile cranes in the image that are not annotated. The image is quite large and detailed, and it is possible that other mobile cranes are present but not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes a significant portion of the surrounding area and not just the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
