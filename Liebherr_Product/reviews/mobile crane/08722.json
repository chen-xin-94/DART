There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it still reasonably encloses the entire mobile crane.\n   - The red bounding box fits well around the smaller mobile crane without being too tight or too loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
