The crane is fully within the box, and the box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose at the top and bottom, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the entire mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
