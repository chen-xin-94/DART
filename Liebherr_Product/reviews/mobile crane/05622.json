In this image, the bounding box does enclose a single mobile crane without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mobile crane, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It reasonably encloses the mobile crane without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
