The box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is correctly annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits the mobile crane, including the extended arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
