In the provided image, there are no visible bounding boxes drawn around any mobile cranes. Therefore, we cannot assess whether the bounding boxes enclose the target objects correctly.\n\n2. **Recall**: This criterion checks if all target objects are localized by a bounding box. Since there are no bounding boxes present in the image, none of the mobile cranes are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: This criterion checks if each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. Again, as there are no bounding boxes present, we cannot evaluate the fit.\n\nGiven the absence of any bounding boxes in the image, the evaluation for all three criteria is negative.\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
