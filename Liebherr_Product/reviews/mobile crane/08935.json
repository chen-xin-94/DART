The crane is partially occluded by other objects, making it difficult to determine if the entire crane is within the bounding box. However, based on the visible part, it seems reasonable.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane visible in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be slightly loose, as it includes some surrounding area that is not part of the mobile crane. However, it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
