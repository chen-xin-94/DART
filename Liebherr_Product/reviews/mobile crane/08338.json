There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are at least two mobile cranes visible, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is reasonably well-fitted to the mobile crane it encloses, but it is slightly loose at the top.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
