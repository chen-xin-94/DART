Each box contains one mobile crane, and the boxes are drawn to include the entire crane, even if parts are occluded by other structures. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Thus, the recall is complete.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the mobile cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes slightly cut off or a small amount of extra space included, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
