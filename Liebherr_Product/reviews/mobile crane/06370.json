The second bounding box (red) also encloses the mobile crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the mobile cranes, including their extended arms.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
