The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some extra space. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes extra space around the crane. The purple one is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
