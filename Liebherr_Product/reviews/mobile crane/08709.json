For example, there are mobile cranes in the background and on the left side of the image that are not enclosed by any bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The purple bounding box (left) and the red bounding box (right) fit well around the mobile cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.",
