The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box seems to cover the entire crane structure.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top and bottom, but it is not excessively so. It captures the entire crane without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
