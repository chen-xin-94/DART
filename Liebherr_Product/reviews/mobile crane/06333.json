The red bounding box encloses the mobile crane on the right, and the purple bounding box encloses the mobile crane on the left. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the respective mobile cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the right fits well around the mobile crane, and the purple bounding box on the left also fits well around the mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are reasonably tight without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
