Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose, including parts of the surrounding area. It could be tighter to better fit the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
