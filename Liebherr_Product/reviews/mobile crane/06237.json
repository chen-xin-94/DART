The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box accurately captures it.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
