It includes a significant portion of the sky and the crane's extended arm, which is not part of the mobile crane itself. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Thus, recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a large area of the sky and the crane's extended arm, which is not necessary to enclose the mobile crane itself. Therefore, the fit is not appropriate.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
