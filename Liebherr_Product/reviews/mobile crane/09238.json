In this image, the red bounding box correctly encloses the mobile crane on the left. The purple bounding box correctly encloses the mobile crane on the right. Both bounding boxes are precise in identifying individual mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the mobile crane on the left, and the purple bounding box fits well around the mobile crane on the right. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
