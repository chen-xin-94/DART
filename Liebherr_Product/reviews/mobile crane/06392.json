Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: The main mobile crane in the foreground is not localized by a bounding box. Hence, recall is not met.\n3. **Fit**: Since the bounding box does not enclose the correct object, the fit criterion is also not applicable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
