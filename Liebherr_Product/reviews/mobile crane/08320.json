In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"mobile crane.\" Each box encloses a single mobile crane, and there is no overlap with other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the mobile cranes well. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
