In this image, the red bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.56\" and the purple bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.60\" each enclose a single mobile crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box and the purple bounding box both fit their respective mobile cranes well, without being too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
