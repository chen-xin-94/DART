The bounding box in the image encloses the mobile crane accurately, including its main body and the crane arm. There is no significant part of another object within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is enclosed by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the crane or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
