Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes significant portions of the surrounding area, including parts of the building and the worker. It does not fit the mobile crane tightly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
