There are no additional mobile cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box (0.62) is neither too loose nor too tight; it fits well around the mobile crane on the left.\n   - The purple bounding box (0.64) is also well-fitted around the mobile crane on the right.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the bounding boxes meet the criteria for precision, recall, and fit.\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
