The red bounding box is more precise but still includes some background. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the purple one, which includes a lot of the background. The red one is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
