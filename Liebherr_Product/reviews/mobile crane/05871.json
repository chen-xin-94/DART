In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"mobile crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single mobile crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded or extend beyond the bounding box. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three mobile cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted to the mobile cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes, even though some parts are slightly cut off or some extra space is included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
