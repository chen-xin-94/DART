However, it does not perfectly enclose the entire crane, as the top part of the crane's arm is cut off. This affects the precision.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. This affects the recall.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly too tight, cutting off the top part of the crane's arm. This affects the fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
