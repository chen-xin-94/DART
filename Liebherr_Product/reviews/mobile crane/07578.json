The entire crane, including the extended arm and hook, is within the box. Therefore, the precision is high.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Thus, recall is complete.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire mobile crane, including the extended arm and hook, without cutting off any significant parts or including unnecessary background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
