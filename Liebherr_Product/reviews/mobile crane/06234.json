The crane is well-defined within the box, even though parts of it are occluded by other elements in the image. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. No other mobile cranes are present that need to be annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, capturing its full height and width without significant overreach or underreach.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
