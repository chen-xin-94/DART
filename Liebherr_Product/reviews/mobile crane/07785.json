It appears to be too small and only captures a part of the mobile crane on the right side of the image. The larger mobile crane on the left side is not enclosed by any bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is a large mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the mobile crane on the right side of the image.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
