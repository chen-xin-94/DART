The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box accurately captures the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
