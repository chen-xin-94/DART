It only captures a part of the crane's arm, missing the rest of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes visible, but only one partial crane is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane, only a part of it.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
