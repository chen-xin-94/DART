The red bounding box on the left encloses one mobile crane, and the purple bounding box on the right encloses another mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted. The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose at the top, but it still reasonably encloses the mobile crane. The purple bounding box on the right is also well-fitted, though it includes a bit of the surrounding area at the bottom.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
