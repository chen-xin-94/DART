Both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual mobile cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the mobile cranes, with slight allowances for the crane arms extending out of the boxes, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
