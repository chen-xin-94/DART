It includes parts of the wind turbine and other structures, which means it is not precise.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes significant portions of the surrounding area and other structures.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
