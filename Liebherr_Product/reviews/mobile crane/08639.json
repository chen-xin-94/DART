However, there is another mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, the precision is not perfect as it does not account for all mobile cranes in the image.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is a mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the mobile crane on the right side of the image is well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight and accurately encloses the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
