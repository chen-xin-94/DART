Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Hence, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top and bottom, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the mobile crane without cutting off significant parts of it.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
