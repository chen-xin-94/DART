It only captures a part of the crane's structure, specifically the vertical section on the right side of the image. The main body of the mobile crane is not enclosed by the bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is at least one mobile crane in the image that is not enclosed by any bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane. It only captures a part of the crane's structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
