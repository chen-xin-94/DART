The bounding box seems to cover the entire mobile crane without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All target objects (mobile cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - In the image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box appears to fit well around the mobile crane, covering the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
