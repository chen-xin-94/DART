The box is drawn around the entire crane, including the extended arm, which is a crucial part of the mobile crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, neither too loose nor too tight. It includes the entire crane without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
