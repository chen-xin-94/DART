The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box captures the entire structure, including the base and the extended arm. \n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire mobile crane without cutting off any significant parts or including too much extraneous area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
