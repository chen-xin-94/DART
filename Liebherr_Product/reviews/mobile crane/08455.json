The purple bounding box encloses the red mobile crane, and the red bounding box encloses the yellow mobile crane. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately enclose the mobile cranes without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
