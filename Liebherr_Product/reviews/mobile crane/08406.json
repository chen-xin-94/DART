Therefore, the precision is not ideal.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Thus, recall is satisfactory.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, as it includes a lot of the surrounding area and does not tightly fit the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
