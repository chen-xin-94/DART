In this image, there are two bounding boxes, and each one encloses a different part of the mobile crane. The first bounding box encloses the base of the crane, and the second one encloses the arm of the crane. This is not ideal as each bounding box should enclose the entire mobile crane as a single object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is localized by the two bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are not enclosing the entire mobile crane as a single object, which means they are not fitting the target object correctly.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all target objects (in this case, the single mobile crane) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes do not fit the target object correctly as they are not enclosing the entire mobile crane as a single object.",
