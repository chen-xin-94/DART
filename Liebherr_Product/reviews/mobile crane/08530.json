It includes a significant portion of the surrounding area, which is not part of the target object. Therefore, the precision is not satisfactory.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Thus, recall is satisfactory.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, as it includes a lot of the surrounding area that is not part of the mobile crane. Therefore, the fit is not satisfactory.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
