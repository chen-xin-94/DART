The red bounding box encloses the left mobile crane, and the blue bounding box encloses the right mobile crane. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately enclose the mobile cranes without cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
