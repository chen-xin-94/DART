In this image, the purple bounding box encloses one mobile crane, and the red bounding box encloses another mobile crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose single target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
