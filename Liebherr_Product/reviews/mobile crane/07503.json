It includes parts of the surrounding environment and is too loose. The purple bounding box also does not perfectly enclose a single mobile crane; it is too tight and cuts off parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose, and the purple bounding box is too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
