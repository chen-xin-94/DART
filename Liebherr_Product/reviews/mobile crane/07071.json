Therefore, the precision is not ideal.\n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane in the image (on the left side). This crane is not annotated, so not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and cuts off parts of the crane, especially the arm. It should be slightly larger to fit the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
