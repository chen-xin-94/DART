The purple bounding box encloses the left mobile crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right mobile crane. There is no significant part of any other object within these bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the left mobile crane, and the red bounding box fits well around the right mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are reasonably tight without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
