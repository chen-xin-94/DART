The bounding box should ideally be more focused on the mobile crane itself. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is a bit loose as it includes some surrounding areas that are not part of the mobile crane. It could be tighter to better fit the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
