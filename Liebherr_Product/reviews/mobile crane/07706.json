It is too small and only covers a small portion of the crane in the background, missing the main crane in the foreground.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. The main mobile crane in the foreground is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose and does not fit the mobile crane properly. It only covers a small part of the crane in the background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
