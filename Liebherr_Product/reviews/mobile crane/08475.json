The bounding box appears to be correctly placed around the mobile crane, even though part of the crane is occluded. The bounding box reasonably estimates the size of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, considering the occlusion.\n\nHere is the evaluation in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
