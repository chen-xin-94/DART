Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one more mobile crane in the image that is not localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is not accurate.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane. Therefore, the fit is not accurate.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
