However, the purple bounding box on the right also correctly encloses one mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right both fit well around the mobile cranes, with a slight allowance for the crane's extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
