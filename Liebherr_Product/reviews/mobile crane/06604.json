It includes a large portion of the boat being lifted, which is not part of the target object. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. So, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the boat and some surrounding area. It should be tighter around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
