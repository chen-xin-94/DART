Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose just the mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the surrounding environment. It could be tighter to better fit the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
