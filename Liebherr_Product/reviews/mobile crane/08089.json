Each box contains one mobile crane, and the boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the mobile cranes well without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
