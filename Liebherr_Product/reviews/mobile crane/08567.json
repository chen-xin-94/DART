The yellow mobile crane on the left is not annotated, which affects precision.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. The yellow mobile crane on the left is missing a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the red mobile crane is slightly loose, as it includes some surrounding area that is not part of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
