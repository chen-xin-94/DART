There are two mobile cranes, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box fits the mobile crane well, covering the entire crane without being too loose or too tight.\n   - The red bounding box also fits the mobile crane well, covering the entire crane without being too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
