The bounding box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane in the image, located on the right side. This crane is not annotated with a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the central mobile crane is well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
