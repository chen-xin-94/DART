Therefore, the precision is not correct.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one mobile crane visible in the image (yellow crane), but it is not annotated. Therefore, recall is not correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the object it encloses (the tower crane), but since it is not enclosing the correct object, this criterion is not applicable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
