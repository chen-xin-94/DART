Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the mobile cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
