It only covers a small portion of the crane, missing the majority of the object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is partially localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane. It only encloses a small part of the crane, making it an incorrect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
