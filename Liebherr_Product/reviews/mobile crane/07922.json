The box is well-placed around the crane, capturing the entire object without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes in the image, and each one is enclosed by a separate bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the mobile cranes, capturing the entire object without significant portions being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
