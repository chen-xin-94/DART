The red bounding box also encloses one mobile crane accurately. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
