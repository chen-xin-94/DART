The crane's boom and other parts are outside the bounding box. Therefore, the bounding box does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it cuts off significant parts of the mobile crane, such as the boom and other components.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
