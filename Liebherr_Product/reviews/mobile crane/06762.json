The bounding box on the right side of the image encloses the entire mobile crane. Therefore, the left bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left is too loose as it only captures the crane's arm and not the entire mobile crane. The bounding box on the right fits well around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
