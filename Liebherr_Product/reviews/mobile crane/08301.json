In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"mobile crane.\" Each bounding box correctly encloses a single mobile crane without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the mobile cranes well, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
