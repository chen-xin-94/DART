In this image, the bounding box accurately encloses the mobile crane without including other objects. The crane is well-defined within the box, even though parts of it are occluded by other elements in the scene.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mobile crane, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mobile cranes in the image that are missed.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nGiven these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
