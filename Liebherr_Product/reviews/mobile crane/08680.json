                "content": "Let's evaluate the bounding boxes based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual mobile cranes without including other objects. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the mobile cranes. They do not cut off significant parts of the cranes nor include excessive outside areas.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
