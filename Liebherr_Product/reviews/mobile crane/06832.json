The annotations are accurate in terms of identifying the target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no missed mobile cranes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted to the mobile cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably enclose the objects without significant cut-offs or excessive outside area.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
