This makes it less precise.\n   - The purple bounding box encloses one mobile crane accurately without including other objects.\n   \n2. **Recall**: \n   - Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the truck and other objects.\n   - The purple bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, neither too tight nor too loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single mobile crane.\n- **Recall** is \"Yes\" because all mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"No\" because the red bounding box is too loose.",
