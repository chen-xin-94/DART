Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane and some surrounding area. It could be tighter to better fit the target object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
