There is a second mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including parts of the structure and other elements, and does not fit the mobile crane accurately.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
