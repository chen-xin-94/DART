In this image, the bounding box does enclose a mobile crane, but it also includes a significant portion of the background and other objects. Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose just the mobile crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple mobile cranes, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area and other objects. It should be tighter around the mobile crane to better fit the object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
