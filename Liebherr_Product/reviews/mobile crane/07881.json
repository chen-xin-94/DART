In this image, there is one mobile crane, and the bounding box accurately encloses it without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is correctly localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, not cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
