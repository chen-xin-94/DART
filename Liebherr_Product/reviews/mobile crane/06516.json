The entire crane is within the box, and the box is not too tight or too loose.\n2. **Recall:** There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, neither cutting off significant parts of the crane nor including excessive outside area.",
