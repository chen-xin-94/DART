It does not include any other objects and is well-aligned with the crane's structure. \n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane in the background lifting an object, which is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
