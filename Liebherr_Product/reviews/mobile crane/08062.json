It includes parts of the building and other structures. The purple bounding box labeled \"mobile\" is also not correctly enclosing a mobile crane; it seems to be around a different structure.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes visible in the image, but not all of them are localized by a bounding box. For example, the mobile crane on the left side of the image is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures. The purple bounding box is also not fitting a mobile crane correctly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
