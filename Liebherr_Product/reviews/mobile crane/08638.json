It seems to be focused on a part of a crane's arm, but not the entire mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes visible in the image, but only one bounding box is present. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane, only a part of it.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
