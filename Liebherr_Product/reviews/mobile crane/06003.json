Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box. There is a visible mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the mobile crane on the right side of the image appears to be well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
