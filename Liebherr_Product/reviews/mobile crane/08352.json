Instead, it encloses two mobile cranes and some additional background elements.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by the bounding box, but they are not individually annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant amount of background and does not tightly fit around the mobile cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
