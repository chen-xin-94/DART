Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose all target objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Hence, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the single mobile crane is reasonably well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
