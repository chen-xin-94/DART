In this image, the bounding box does enclose a single mobile crane. The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box seems to cover the entire crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is one mobile crane, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box appears to fit the mobile crane well, covering the entire structure without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
