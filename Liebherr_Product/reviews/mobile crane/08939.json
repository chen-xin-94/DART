It is too small and only covers a part of the crane's arm, missing the rest of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one mobile crane in the image that is not localized by a bounding box. The visible mobile crane is not fully enclosed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fit the entire mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
