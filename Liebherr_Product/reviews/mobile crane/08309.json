The bounding box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: The single mobile crane in the image is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mobile crane, including its extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
