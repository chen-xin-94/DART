In this image, the bounding box does not enclose the entire mobile crane. It only captures a part of the crane, missing significant portions of it.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is partially localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box is too tight as it does not cover the entire mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box does not perfectly enclose the entire mobile crane.\n- **Recall**: No, because the bounding box does not localize the entire mobile crane.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane.",
