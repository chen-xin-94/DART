Therefore, I cannot assess whether each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: Are all target objects localized by a bounding box?\n   - Since there are no bounding boxes visible in the image, none of the mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Is each bounding box neither too loose nor too tight?\n   - Again, as there are no bounding boxes present, I cannot evaluate the fit of the bounding boxes.\n\nGiven the absence of bounding boxes in the image, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
