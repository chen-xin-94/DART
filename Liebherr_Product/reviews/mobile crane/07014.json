In this image, there is one mobile crane, and the bounding box should cover it entirely without including other objects. Since there is no bounding box shown in the image, we cannot evaluate this criterion.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is one mobile crane, and it should be enclosed by a bounding box. Since there is no bounding box shown in the image, we cannot evaluate this criterion.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. It should reasonably enclose the mobile crane without cutting off significant parts of it or including too much outside area. Since there is no bounding box shown in the image, we cannot evaluate this criterion.\n\nGiven that there are no bounding boxes present in the image, we cannot provide a meaningful evaluation for precision, recall, and fit.\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
