Both bounding boxes seem to perfectly enclose one single target object each, without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the mobile cranes appropriately, even considering slight occlusions.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
