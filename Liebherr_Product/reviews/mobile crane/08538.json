Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane in the image (on the right side) that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area and does not tightly fit the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
