The crane is well-defined within the box, and no other objects are included.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the mobile crane well, even though the crane is partially occluded by other objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
