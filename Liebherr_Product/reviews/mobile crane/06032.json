The crane is well-defined within the box, and the box is not too loose or too tight. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Therefore, the recall is good.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits the mobile crane well. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably estimates the size of the crane, even if some parts are slightly occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
