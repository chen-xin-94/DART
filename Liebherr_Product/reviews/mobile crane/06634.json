The rest of the crane, including the extended arm and the load it is lifting, is not enclosed within the bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is partially localized by the bounding box. However, since the bounding box does not cover the entire crane, it does not fully meet the recall criterion.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it only covers a part of the mobile crane. It should be extended to include the entire crane, including the extended arm and the load it is lifting.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
