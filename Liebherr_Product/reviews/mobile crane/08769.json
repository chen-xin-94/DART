The red bounding box encloses the yellow mobile crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the red mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the mobile cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes slightly outside the boxes, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
