The right bounding box (red) also correctly encloses a single mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are precise in identifying individual mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) is slightly loose at the top, but it reasonably encloses the entire mobile crane. The right bounding box (red) is also slightly loose but reasonably encloses the mobile crane. Both bounding boxes fit well enough to be considered correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
