In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"mobile crane.\" Each box seems to enclose a single mobile crane without including other objects. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three mobile cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the mobile cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs, which are acceptable.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
