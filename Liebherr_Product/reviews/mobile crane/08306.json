It seems to cover the entire crane, including the extended arm.\n   - The second bounding box (purple) also encloses a mobile crane. It covers the entire crane, including the extended arm.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose at the bottom, but it reasonably covers the entire crane.\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose at the bottom, but it reasonably covers the entire crane.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
