There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the mobile crane.\n   - The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the mobile crane.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight to a significant degree.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
