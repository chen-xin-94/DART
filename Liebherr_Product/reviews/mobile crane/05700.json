Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately cover the mobile cranes without significant portions being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
