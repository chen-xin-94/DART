The purple bounding box is more accurate but includes some extra space. Overall, the bounding boxes do enclose the target objects, but the red one is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too tight, cutting off part of the crane's arm. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
