The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box seems to cover the entire crane without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
