In this image, the bounding box does enclose a mobile crane, but it also includes some parts of the surrounding environment. However, it is not enclosing multiple objects, so it is acceptable.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mobile crane, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, including some parts of the surrounding environment, but it is not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
