                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the purple bounding box correctly encloses one mobile crane. The red bounding box also encloses one mobile crane, but it includes a bit of the surrounding area. However, it is still reasonable.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the mobile crane. The red bounding box is slightly loose but still acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
