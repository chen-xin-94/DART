Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane. However, it is not excessively loose, and the crane is well within the bounds of the box. Therefore, the fit is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
