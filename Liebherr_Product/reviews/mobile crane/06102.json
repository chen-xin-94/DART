This makes the precision slightly off.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one other mobile crane in the image that is not annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is a bit loose, including some extra area around the crane, but it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
