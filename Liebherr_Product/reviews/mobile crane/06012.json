The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box is drawn around it.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the bottom, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the mobile crane without cutting off significant parts of it.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
