It includes only part of one mobile crane and misses the other mobile cranes entirely.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is partially enclosed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes a significant amount of background and does not tightly fit the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
