The crane is well-defined within the box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the mobile crane well, even though the top part of the crane is slightly cut off, it is within acceptable limits.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
