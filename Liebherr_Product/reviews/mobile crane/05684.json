Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits the mobile crane, including its extended arm, without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
