The crane is fully within the box, and no other objects are included.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially on the right side where it extends beyond the crane. However, it is not excessively loose, and the crane is still well-contained within the box.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
