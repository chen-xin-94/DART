The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box captures the entire structure, including the extended arm. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Hence, recall is also good.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire mobile crane without cutting off any significant parts or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
