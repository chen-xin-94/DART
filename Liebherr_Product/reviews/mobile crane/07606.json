The crane is fully within the box, and the box is not too loose or too tight.\n   - The second bounding box (red) also encloses a single mobile crane. The crane is fully within the box, and the box is not too loose or too tight.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding boxes are well-fitted to the mobile cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably enclose the entire structure of the cranes.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
