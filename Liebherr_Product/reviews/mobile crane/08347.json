The box is drawn around the crane's structure, including the arm and the base. There is no significant part of another object within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the mobile cranes, including the arm and the base, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
