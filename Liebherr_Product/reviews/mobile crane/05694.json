The crane is well-defined within the box, even though parts of it are occluded by trees and other structures. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire mobile crane, including the parts that are occluded, without cutting off significant portions of the crane or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
