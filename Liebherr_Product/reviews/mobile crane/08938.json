It is instead enclosing a tall structure that is not a mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box. There is at least one mobile crane visible in the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is not fitting the mobile crane at all, as it is enclosing a different structure.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
