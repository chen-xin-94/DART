The one on the right (purple box) is more precise but still includes some extra space. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the one on the left, which includes additional structures. The one on the right is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
