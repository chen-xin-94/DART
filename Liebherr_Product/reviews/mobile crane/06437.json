It includes part of the ship and the crane's boom, which is not part of the mobile crane itself. The bounding box labeled \"crane\" is also not a mobile crane, so it should not be considered.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the mobile crane is too loose as it includes parts of the ship and the crane's boom.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
