In this image, the bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.51\" correctly encloses the mobile crane in the background. The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.52\" correctly encloses the mobile crane in the foreground. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.51\" is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the crane. The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.52\" fits well around the mobile crane in the foreground.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
