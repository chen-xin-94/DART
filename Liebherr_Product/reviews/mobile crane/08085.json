This means it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the structure next to the crane. The red bounding box is a good fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
