In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual mobile cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the mobile cranes, with a slight margin that is acceptable. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
