However, it also includes a significant portion of the crane's extended arm, which is part of the mobile crane. Therefore, it is acceptable.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the entire mobile crane, including its extended arm.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
