However, the crane is quite small in the image, and the bounding box seems to be reasonably placed around it.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, considering the small size of the object in the image.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
