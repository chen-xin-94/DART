Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly too loose as it includes part of another crane and some extra space around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
