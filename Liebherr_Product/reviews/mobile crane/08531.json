The entire crane is within the box, and no other objects are mistakenly included.\n2. **Recall:** There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, with no significant parts of the crane being cut off or excessive outside area being included.",
