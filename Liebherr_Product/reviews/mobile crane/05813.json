This makes the bounding box too loose and not perfectly enclosing the target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of unnecessary surrounding area. It should be tighter around the mobile crane to better fit the object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
