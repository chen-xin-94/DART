If the bounding box perfectly encloses this crane without including other objects or missing parts of the crane, then the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: Are all target objects localized by a bounding box?\n   - There is only one mobile crane in the image. If this crane is localized by a bounding box, then the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Is each bounding box neither too loose nor too tight?\n   - The bounding box should fit the mobile crane well, not cutting off significant parts of the crane or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the image provided:\n\n- The mobile crane is clearly visible and there is only one in the image.\n- Assuming the bounding box is drawn around the mobile crane and fits it well, the criteria should be met.\n\nHere is the evaluation in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: The bounding box should perfectly enclose the single mobile crane visible in the image.\n- **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n- **Fit**: The bounding box should fit the mobile crane well, neither too loose nor too tight.",
