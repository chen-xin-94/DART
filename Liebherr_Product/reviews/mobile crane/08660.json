Therefore, we cannot assess whether each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Since there are no bounding boxes, it means no mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Without any bounding boxes, we cannot evaluate whether they are too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No bounding boxes are present to evaluate.\n- **Recall**: No mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No bounding boxes are present to evaluate their fit.",
