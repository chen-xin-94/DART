                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the mobile cranes, but the red bounding box on the right seems to be too tight and does not fully enclose the entire crane. The purple bounding box on the left also seems to be too loose, including some extra area. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible mobile cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes, so the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. As mentioned, the red bounding box on the right is too tight, and the purple bounding box on the left is too loose. Therefore, the fit is not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
