The purple box encloses the left mobile crane, and the red box encloses the right mobile crane. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately enclose the mobile cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
