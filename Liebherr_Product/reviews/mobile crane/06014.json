                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, both bounding boxes seem to enclose individual mobile cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit the mobile cranes well, with a reasonable margin that neither cuts off parts of the cranes nor includes too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
