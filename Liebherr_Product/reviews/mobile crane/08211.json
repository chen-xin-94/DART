The purple bounding box on the right also correctly encloses a mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose but still acceptable as it encloses the entire mobile crane. The purple bounding box on the right is also slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
