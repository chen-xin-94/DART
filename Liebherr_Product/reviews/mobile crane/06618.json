The boxes are reasonably inferred even though parts of the cranes are occluded by the building and the sky.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately cover the cranes without significant portions being outside the boxes or excessive empty space within the boxes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
