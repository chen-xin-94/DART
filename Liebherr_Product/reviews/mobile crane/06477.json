In the image, there are three bounding boxes, each enclosing a mobile crane. The bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the mobile cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three mobile cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the mobile cranes, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
