The box is well-placed around the crane, even though the crane is partially occluded by itself (the tire). This is acceptable as the bounding box is inferred based on a reasonable estimation of the crane's size.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, with slight allowances for the edges which are acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
