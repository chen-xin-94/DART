It seems to be too loose and includes a lot of background.\n   - The red bounding box on the right does enclose a mobile crane, but it also includes a significant portion of the background, making it too loose.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box on the left is too loose and does not fit the mobile crane well.\n   - The red bounding box on the right is also too loose and includes unnecessary background.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the mobile cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all mobile cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are too loose and include too much background.",
