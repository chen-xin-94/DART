Instead, it encloses a part of a vehicle and some people, which are not the target object. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one mobile crane in the image (the large vehicle carrying the rock), but it is not annotated. Therefore, the recall is not met.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the scene that are not part of the mobile crane. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
