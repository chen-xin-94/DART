The image contains two mobile cranes, but the bounding box only encloses one of them.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is a second mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated mobile crane is reasonably well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
