In this image, the bounding box does enclose the mobile crane accurately without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, covering its entire structure without significant parts being cut off or excessive empty space.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
