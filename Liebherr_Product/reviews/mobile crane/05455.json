The orange mobile crane is enclosed by the purple bounding box, and the red mobile crane is enclosed by the red bounding box. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify and enclose the mobile cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box around the orange mobile crane is slightly loose but still reasonable. The red bounding box around the red mobile crane is also slightly loose but acceptable. Both bounding boxes fit the mobile cranes well enough without significant issues.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
