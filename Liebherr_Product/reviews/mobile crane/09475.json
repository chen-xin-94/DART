In the image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"mobile crane.\" Each box seems to enclose a mobile crane, but the purple box on the left appears to include part of another crane's boom, which affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three mobile cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the mobile cranes reasonably well, though the purple box on the left is slightly loose as it includes part of another crane's boom.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the purple box on the left includes part of another crane's boom.\n- **Recall**: Yes, all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, the purple box on the left is slightly loose.\n\nHere is the JSON format evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
