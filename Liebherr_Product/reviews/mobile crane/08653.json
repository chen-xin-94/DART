The bounding box seems to cover the entire mobile crane without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (mobile cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - In the image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is enclosed by a bounding box. There are no other mobile cranes visible in the image.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box appears to fit well around the mobile crane, covering the entire crane without significant portions being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nThe bounding box correctly encloses the mobile crane, all mobile cranes in the image are localized, and the fit of the bounding box is appropriate.",
