It only covers a small portion of the crane's base and misses the majority of the crane's structure.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, but only one is partially annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane. It only encloses a small part of the crane's base.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
