The right bounding box (red) is more accurate but still includes some extra space. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The left bounding box (purple) is too loose, while the right bounding box (red) is reasonably well-fitted but could be slightly tighter.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
