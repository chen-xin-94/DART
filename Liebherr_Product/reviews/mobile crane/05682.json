The box is drawn around the mobile crane on the right side of the image, and it does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It reasonably encloses the mobile crane, including its extended arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
