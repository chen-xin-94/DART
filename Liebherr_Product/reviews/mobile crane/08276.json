Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present. Thus, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the two mobile cranes it encloses, but since it should only enclose one mobile crane, it is not a correct fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
