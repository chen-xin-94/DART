The crane is well-defined within the box, even though parts of it are occluded by other elements in the scene. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the mobile crane well, considering the occlusion and the overall size of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
