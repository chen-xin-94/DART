The bounding box on the right does enclose a mobile crane correctly.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left is too loose as it only captures a part of the crane's arm. The bounding box on the right fits well around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
