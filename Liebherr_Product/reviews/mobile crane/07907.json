The box is well-placed around the crane, even though parts of the crane are occluded by the text label.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
