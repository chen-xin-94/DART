The crane is well within the boundaries of the box, and the box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
