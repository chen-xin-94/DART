However, it seems to be a reasonable estimation.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane visible in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be slightly too tight, as it cuts off parts of the crane. However, it is not excessively tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
