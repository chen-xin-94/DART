In this image, the red bounding box encloses one mobile crane accurately, and the purple bounding box also encloses another mobile crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, and the purple bounding box also fits well around the other mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
