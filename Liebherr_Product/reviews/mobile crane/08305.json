It includes parts of the crane but also a significant portion of the surrounding area. The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some surrounding area.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose, including a lot of unnecessary background. The purple bounding box is better but still includes some extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
