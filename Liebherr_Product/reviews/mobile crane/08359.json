This reduces the precision of the bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, as it includes a lot of unnecessary background and other objects. It should be tighter around the mobile crane to improve the fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
