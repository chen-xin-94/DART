The red bounding box on the left correctly encloses the smaller mobile crane, and the purple bounding box on the right correctly encloses the larger mobile crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left fits well around the smaller mobile crane, and the purple bounding box on the right fits well around the larger mobile crane.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
