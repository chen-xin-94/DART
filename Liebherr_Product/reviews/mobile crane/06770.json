There is no significant part of the crane outside the box, and it does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane in the background on the left side of the image that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane in the foreground. It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
