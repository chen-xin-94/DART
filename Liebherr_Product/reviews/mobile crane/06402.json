The box is drawn around the entire crane, even though parts of it are occluded by the building.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It includes the entire crane without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.",
