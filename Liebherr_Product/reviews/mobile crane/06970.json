The bounding box is correctly placed around the mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, even though the crane's arm extends outside the box, which is acceptable given the context.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
