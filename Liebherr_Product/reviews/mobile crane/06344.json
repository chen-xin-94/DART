In this image, the red bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.52\" does not perfectly enclose a single mobile crane. It includes parts of the crane and other structures. The purple bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.53\" also does not perfectly enclose a single mobile crane; it includes parts of the crane and other structures.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes visible, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of extra area that is not part of the mobile crane. The purple bounding box is also too loose, including extra areas that are not part of the mobile crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
