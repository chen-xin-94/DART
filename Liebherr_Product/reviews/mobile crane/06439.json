The box is well-placed around the mobile crane, even though part of the crane is occluded by the person standing in front of it. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
