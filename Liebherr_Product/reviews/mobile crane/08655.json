In this image, the bounding box does enclose a single mobile crane, but it also includes parts of another crane and some surrounding objects. Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple mobile cranes, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose, including parts of another crane and some surrounding objects. It is not too tight, but it is not a perfect fit either.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
