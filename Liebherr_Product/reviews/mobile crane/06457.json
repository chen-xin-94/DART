Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the mobile cranes well, with a reasonable margin that does not cut off significant parts of the cranes or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
