Therefore, we cannot determine if each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Since there are no bounding boxes present, it means that the target object (mobile crane) is not localized by any bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: As there are no bounding boxes, we cannot evaluate if the bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
