The box is drawn around the entire crane, including the extended arm.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There is only one mobile crane in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, including the extended arm and the base.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
