The box is well-placed around the crane, even though part of the crane is occluded by the person standing in front of it. The occlusion is minimal and does not affect the precision significantly.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
