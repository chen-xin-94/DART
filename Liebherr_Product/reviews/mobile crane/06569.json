It only partially encloses one of the mobile cranes, missing significant parts of it.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is partially annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose and does not fit the mobile crane well. It includes a lot of unnecessary background and misses parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
