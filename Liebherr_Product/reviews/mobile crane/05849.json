The crane's arm extends beyond the top of the bounding box, indicating that the bounding box is too tight.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it cuts off the top part of the crane's arm. It should be extended to fully enclose the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
