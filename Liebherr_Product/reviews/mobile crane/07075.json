The blue bounding box, however, does enclose a single mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the blue bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The blue bounding box is a good fit for the mobile crane, neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose and includes unnecessary parts of the image.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
