The crane is well within the bounds of the box, and the box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, including the extended arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
