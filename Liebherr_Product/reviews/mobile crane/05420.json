This is acceptable as the arm is part of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the mobile crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
