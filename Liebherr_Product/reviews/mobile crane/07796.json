There is no significant part of the crane outside the bounding box, and it does not include any other objects. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains only one mobile crane, and it is localized by the bounding box. There are no other mobile cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It includes the entire mobile crane, including the extended arm, without cutting off any significant parts or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
