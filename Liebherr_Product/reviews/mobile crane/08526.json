                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding box does enclose a single mobile crane. The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box captures the entire crane, including its extended arm. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Hence, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially on the left and right sides, but it does not cut off any part of the crane. It captures the entire crane without being too tight or too loose. Therefore, the fit is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
