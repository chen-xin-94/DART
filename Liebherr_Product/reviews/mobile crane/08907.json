The box includes the entire crane, even though part of it is occluded by the person standing in front of it. This is acceptable as the occlusion is minimal and the bounding box is inferred correctly.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mobile crane, including all parts of the crane without significant extra space or cutting off parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
