In this image, the purple bounding box encloses one mobile crane, and the red bounding box encloses another mobile crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the larger mobile crane, and the red bounding box fits well around the smaller mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
