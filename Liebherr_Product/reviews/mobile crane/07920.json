However, the bounding box on the right (purple) is slightly off, as it includes part of the building and does not fully enclose the crane's arm. The other two bounding boxes (red and blue) seem to enclose the cranes accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three mobile cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red and blue bounding boxes fit well around the cranes. The purple bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the building and does not fully enclose the crane's arm.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
