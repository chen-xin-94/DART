Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane.\n   - The red bounding box fits well around the mobile crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Precision**: The purple bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object as it includes parts of another crane.\n- **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: The purple bounding box is too loose, including parts of another crane.",
