Therefore, the precision is not perfect as it does not account for all mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are at least three other mobile cranes visible in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated mobile crane appears to be well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
