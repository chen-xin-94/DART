In this image, the purple bounding box on the left correctly encloses a single mobile crane. The red bounding box on the right also correctly encloses a single mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are precise in identifying individual mobile cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left fits well around the mobile crane, and the red bounding box on the right also fits well around the mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
