The crane is well-defined within the box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the mobile crane well, with no significant parts of the crane being cut off or excessive outside area being included.",
