Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose all target objects.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is a second mobile crane on the left side that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the right mobile crane is reasonably well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
