                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the larger bounding box (purple) correctly encloses the entire mobile crane. The smaller bounding box (red) also correctly encloses a part of the mobile crane, which is acceptable as it is a zoomed-in view. Therefore, both bounding boxes are precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is localized by both bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The larger bounding box (purple) fits well around the mobile crane, and the smaller bounding box (red) also fits well around the zoomed-in part of the crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
