                "content": "Let's evaluate the bounding boxes based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object. In the image, there are two bounding boxes. The left bounding box (purple) encloses one mobile crane accurately. The right bounding box (red) also encloses one mobile crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two mobile cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) fits well around the mobile crane, and the right bounding box (red) also fits well around the mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
