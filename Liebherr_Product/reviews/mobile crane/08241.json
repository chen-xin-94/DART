Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of another crane and some surrounding objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
