It only encloses a part of one crane, and there are other cranes in the image that are not enclosed.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes visible, but only one is partially enclosed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane. It only covers a small portion of one crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
