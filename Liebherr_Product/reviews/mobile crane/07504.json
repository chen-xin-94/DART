However, it also includes a significant portion of the background, making it too loose.\n   - The purple bounding box labeled \"mobile crane 0.66\" encloses a part of another mobile crane, but it does not cover the entire crane, making it too tight and incomplete.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two mobile cranes in the image. Both are localized by bounding boxes, but the purple bounding box does not fully enclose the second crane.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the background.\n   - The purple bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the mobile cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are either too loose or too tight.",
