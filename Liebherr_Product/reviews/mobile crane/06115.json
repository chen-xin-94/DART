The bounding box does not include any other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: Are all target objects localized by a bounding box?\n   - There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Is each bounding box neither too loose nor too tight?\n   - The bounding box fits the mobile crane well. It is not too loose, as it does not include excessive background, and it is not too tight, as it does not cut off significant parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
