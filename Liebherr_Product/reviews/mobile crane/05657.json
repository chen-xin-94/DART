It includes parts of other cranes and does not fully cover the mobile crane it is supposed to annotate.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (mobile cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes parts of other cranes and does not tightly fit the mobile crane it is supposed to annotate.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
