The bounding box is too narrow and does not cover the entire width of the crane, especially the base and the arm.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight, especially around the base and the arm of the crane. It should be wider to fully enclose the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
