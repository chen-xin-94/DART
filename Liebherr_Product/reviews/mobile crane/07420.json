The bounding box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is another mobile crane in the background on the right side of the image, which is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably estimates the crane's size, even though parts of it are occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
