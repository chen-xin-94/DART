The bounding box in the image encloses the mobile crane accurately, including its arm and base. There is no other object within the bounding box, and it does not miss any part of the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is only one mobile crane, and it is correctly localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, including its arm and base, without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
