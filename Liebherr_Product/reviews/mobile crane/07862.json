The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane\" (purple) encloses the mobile crane on the right side of the image. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box labeled \"mobile\" (red) is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the mobile crane. The bounding box labeled \"mobile crane\" (purple) is slightly tight but still reasonably fits the mobile crane. Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight to a significant degree.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
