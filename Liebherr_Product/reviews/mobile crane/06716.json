It includes parts of two mobile cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mobile cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are at least two mobile cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of two mobile cranes and a significant amount of background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
