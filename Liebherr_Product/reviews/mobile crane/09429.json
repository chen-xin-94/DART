There are multiple mobile cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes parts of the structure and other cranes, which should not be part of the bounding box.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
