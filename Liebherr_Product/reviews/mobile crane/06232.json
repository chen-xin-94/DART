The purple bounding box encloses the mobile crane on the left, and the red bounding box encloses the mobile crane on the right. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional mobile cranes that are not annotated. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted. The purple bounding box slightly cuts off the top of the crane, but it is within acceptable limits. The red bounding box also fits well around the crane. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
