This means it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n   - The purple bounding box encloses a single mobile crane accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - Both mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes additional structures and another crane.\n   - The purple bounding box fits well around the mobile crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall** is \"Yes\" because all mobile cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"No\" because the red bounding box is too loose.",
