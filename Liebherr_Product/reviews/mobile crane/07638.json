It only captures a part of the crane, specifically the base and a small portion of the arm. The rest of the crane's arm is not included in the bounding box. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. However, since the bounding box does not fully capture the crane, the recall is not fully accurate.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire mobile crane. It misses a significant portion of the crane's arm, which extends horizontally across the image.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
