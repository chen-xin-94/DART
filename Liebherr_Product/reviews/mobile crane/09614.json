The box is drawn around the entire crane, including the extended arm, which is a crucial part of the mobile crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mobile crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire mobile crane, including the extended arm, without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
