Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the mobile cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two mobile cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the mobile cranes, with a reasonable margin that neither cuts off parts of the cranes nor includes too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
