In the image, there is one mobile crane, and the bounding box should enclose it entirely. Since there is no bounding box provided in the image, we cannot evaluate this criterion.\n\n2. **Recall**: This criterion checks if all target objects are localized by a bounding box. In the image, there is one mobile crane, and it should be enclosed by a bounding box. Since there is no bounding box provided in the image, we cannot evaluate this criterion.\n\n3. **Fit**: This criterion checks if each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. Since there is no bounding box provided in the image, we cannot evaluate this criterion.\n\nGiven that there are no bounding boxes provided in the image, we cannot evaluate the correctness of the bounding box annotations.\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
