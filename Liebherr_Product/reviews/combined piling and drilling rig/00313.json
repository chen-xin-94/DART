In this image, the purple bounding box encloses one combined piling and drilling rig accurately. The red bounding box also encloses another combined piling and drilling rig accurately. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two combined piling and drilling rigs, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the combined piling and drilling rig, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other combined piling and drilling rig. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
