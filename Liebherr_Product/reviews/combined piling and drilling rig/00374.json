In this image, there are three bounding boxes, each enclosing a combined piling and drilling rig. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and seem to correctly identify the target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three combined piling and drilling rigs, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the combined piling and drilling rigs, with no significant parts of the objects being cut off or excessive empty space within the boxes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
