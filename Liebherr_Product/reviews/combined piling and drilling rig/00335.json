The bounding box on the left, however, encloses a different type of machinery (a loader or excavator), not a combined piling and drilling rig. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one combined piling and drilling rig in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the right is well-fitted to the combined piling and drilling rig, neither too loose nor too tight. Therefore, the fit is met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
