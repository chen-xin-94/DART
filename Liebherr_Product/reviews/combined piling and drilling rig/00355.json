There is no significant occlusion, and the bounding box accurately captures the entire rig.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one combined piling and drilling rig in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the combined piling and drilling rig, capturing the entire structure without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
