Both bounding boxes seem to perfectly enclose one single target object each, even though the left one is partially occluded by another structure. The bounding boxes are inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are two combined piling and drilling rigs in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the target objects well, with slight allowances for occlusion and external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
