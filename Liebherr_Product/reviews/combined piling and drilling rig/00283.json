However, the left bounding box also includes part of another structure (a crane or similar equipment) which is not part of the target object. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (combined piling and drilling rigs) in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted to the target objects, though the left bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of another structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
