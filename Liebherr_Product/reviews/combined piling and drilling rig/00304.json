It seems to cover the entire rig, including the base and the drilling arm.\n   - The second bounding box (red) also encloses a combined piling and drilling rig. It covers the entire rig, including the base and the drilling arm.\n   - Both bounding boxes seem to perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two combined piling and drilling rigs in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box (purple) is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the rig, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - The second bounding box (red) is also slightly loose, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too tight nor too loose to a significant degree.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
