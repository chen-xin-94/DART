In this image, there are two bounding boxes, each enclosing a combined piling and drilling rig. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two combined piling and drilling rigs in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the rigs. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the objects.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
