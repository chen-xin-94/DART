It seems to perfectly enclose the target object without including other objects.\n   - The purple bounding box on the left side of the image also encloses a combined piling and drilling rig. It seems to perfectly enclose the target object without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - There are two combined piling and drilling rigs in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The red bounding box on the right side of the image is neither too loose nor too tight; it fits well around the target object.\n   - The purple bounding box on the left side of the image is also neither too loose nor too tight; it fits well around the target object.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
