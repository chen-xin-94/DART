The bounding box on the right also encloses one single combined piling and drilling rig.

There are no additional rigs that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They appropriately enclose the target objects without significant portions being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
