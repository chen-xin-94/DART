The box is well-placed around the rig, even though some parts of the rig are occluded by other elements in the image.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one combined piling and drilling rig in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the combined piling and drilling rig, considering the occlusions and the overall size of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
