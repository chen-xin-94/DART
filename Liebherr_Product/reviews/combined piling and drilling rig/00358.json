In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose one combined piling and drilling rig each. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two combined piling and drilling rigs, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the combined piling and drilling rigs, with no significant parts of the rigs being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
