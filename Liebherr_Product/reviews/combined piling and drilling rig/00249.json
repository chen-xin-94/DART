In this image, the left bounding box accurately encloses one combined piling and drilling rig. The right bounding box also accurately encloses another combined piling and drilling rig. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two combined piling and drilling rigs, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box fits well around the combined piling and drilling rig, and the right bounding box also fits well around the other combined piling and drilling rig. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
