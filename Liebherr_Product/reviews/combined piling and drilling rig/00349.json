The rig is well-defined within the box, and the occlusion is minimal and reasonably estimated.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one combined piling and drilling rig in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the rig, with slight allowances for minor occlusions and external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
