However, the bounding box labeled \"combined piling and drilling rig\" (red) incorrectly encloses a power line structure, which is not a combined piling and drilling rig. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose the target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one combined piling and drilling rig in the image, and it is localized by the purple bounding box. The red bounding box does not enclose a combined piling and drilling rig, so it does not affect the recall.\n\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box is slightly loose but generally fits the combined piling and drilling rig well. The red bounding box is irrelevant as it does not enclose the target object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
