It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because the purple bounding box incorrectly identifies a different type of machinery as a combined piling and drilling rig.\n- **Recall** is \"Yes\" because the only combined piling and drilling rig in the image is localized by the red bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"Yes\" because the red bounding box fits the combined piling and drilling rig appropriately.",
