The object is not occluded, so the bounding box is accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining bulldozer, with slight margins that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
