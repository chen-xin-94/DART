There is no occlusion, and the entire bulldozer is within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining bulldozer, and it is localized by a bounding box. There is no mining excavator in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining bulldozer, with no significant parts of the bulldozer being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
