There is no occlusion, and the object is clearly visible within the box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators present in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining bulldozer, with a slight margin that does not cut off any part of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
