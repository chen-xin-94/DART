In this image, the bounding boxes for the mining bulldozer and the mining excavator each enclose one single target object. The mining bulldozer is fully enclosed within the red bounding box, and the mining excavator is fully enclosed within the purple bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there is one mining bulldozer and one mining excavator, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes for both the mining bulldozer and the mining excavator appear to be well-fitted. They are not too loose, as they do not include excessive background, and they are not too tight, as they do not cut off significant parts of the objects.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
