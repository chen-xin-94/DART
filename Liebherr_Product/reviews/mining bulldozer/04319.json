The object is not occluded, and the bounding box seems to be correctly placed around the bulldozer.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining bulldozer, capturing the entire object without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
