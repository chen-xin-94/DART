There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is correctly placed around the bulldozer.\n2. **Recall:** The image contains one mining bulldozer, and it is localized by a bounding box. There is no mining excavator in the image, but that is acceptable as per the instructions.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately covers the mining bulldozer, including the parts that are visible and reasonably estimating the occluded parts.",
