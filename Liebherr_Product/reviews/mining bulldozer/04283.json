There is no other object within the bounding box, and it accurately captures the target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining bulldozer, and it is localized by a bounding box. There is no mining excavator in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining bulldozer, even though the bottom part is slightly occluded by the dirt, which is acceptable based on reasonable estimation.",
