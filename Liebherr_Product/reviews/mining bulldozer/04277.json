The object is not occluded, and the bounding box accurately captures the entire bulldozer.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators in the image that need to be annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining bulldozer, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
