There is no overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining bulldozer without cutting off significant parts of it or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
