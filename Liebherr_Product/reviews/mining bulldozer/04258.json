However, there is another mining bulldozer in the image that is not enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is a mining bulldozer on the right side of the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the mining bulldozer on the left side of the image is reasonably well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
