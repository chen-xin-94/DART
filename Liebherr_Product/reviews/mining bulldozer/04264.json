There is no overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining bulldozer, even though part of the bulldozer is occluded by dirt.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
