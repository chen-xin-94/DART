There are no other objects within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining bulldozer, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining bulldozer without cutting off significant parts of the object or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
