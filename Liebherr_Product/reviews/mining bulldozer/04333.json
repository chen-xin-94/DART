There is no overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining bulldozer, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining bulldozers or mining excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining bulldozer, including the front part which is interacting with the rocks.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
