The box is well-aligned with the truck mixer, even though some parts of the truck are occluded. Therefore, the precision is good.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one truck mixer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Thus, recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the truck mixer, considering the occlusion and the overall size of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
