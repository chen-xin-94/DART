There are two truck mixers, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the left truck mixer.\n   - The red bounding box is slightly tight but still reasonably fits the right truck mixer.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
