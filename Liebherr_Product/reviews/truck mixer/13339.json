Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one truck mixer each, even though the yellow truck mixer is slightly occluded by the green truck mixer.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two truck mixers in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the truck mixers, with only minor areas of the background included, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
