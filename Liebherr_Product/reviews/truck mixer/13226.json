The purple bounding box encloses the orange truck mixer, and the red bounding box encloses the green truck mixer. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual truck mixers.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two truck mixers, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box around the orange truck mixer is well-fitted, and the red bounding box around the green truck mixer is also well-fitted. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
