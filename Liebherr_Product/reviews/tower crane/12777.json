                "content": "1. **Precision**: Both bounding boxes seem to enclose single tower cranes. The purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box on the right each enclose one tower crane. There is no significant occlusion that would make the bounding boxes inaccurate.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple tower cranes, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes appear to be neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
