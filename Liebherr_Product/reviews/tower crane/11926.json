In the image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single tower crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded by trees or other objects. The bounding boxes are inferred reasonably based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are four visible tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and reasonable estimations of the cranes' sizes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
