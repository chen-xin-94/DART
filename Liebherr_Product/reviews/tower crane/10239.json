It seems to cover the entire crane, including the jib and the tower.\n   - The second bounding box (red) encloses the right tower crane. It also seems to cover the entire crane, including the jib and the tower.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the entire crane.\n   - The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably encloses the entire crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
