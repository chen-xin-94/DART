However, assuming \"crane\" refers to \"tower crane,\" the bounding boxes do enclose the target objects. The bounding boxes do not enclose multiple objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, although some minor adjustments could be made for a perfect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
