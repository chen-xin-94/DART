Each bounding box should ideally enclose one tower crane without overlapping with others. The current annotations do not meet this criterion well.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by the bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, but the significant overlap between them suggests that the fit could be improved.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes overlap significantly and do not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes overlap too much, indicating that the fit is not optimal.",
