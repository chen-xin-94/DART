The red box also encloses the entire structure of the second crane. Both boxes are correctly placed around the cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
