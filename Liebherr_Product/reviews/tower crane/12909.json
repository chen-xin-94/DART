The bounding box in blue also encloses a single tower crane but includes some surrounding area. The bounding box in orange is too small and does not fully enclose the tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red and blue bounding boxes are slightly loose, including some surrounding area. The orange bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
