However, the bounding box on the left side does not enclose a tower crane; it seems to be a part of the construction site or another structure. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. However, the left bounding box is incorrect and does not contribute to recall.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the right side is well-fitted to the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
