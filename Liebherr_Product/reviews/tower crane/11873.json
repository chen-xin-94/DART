In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the one on the left is partially occluded by the worker. However, the bounding box still reasonably estimates the size of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes appropriately without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
