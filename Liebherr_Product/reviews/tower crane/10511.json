In this image, there are three bounding boxes, and each one encloses a single tower crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
