There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the background and other objects.\n   - The purple bounding box is also too loose, including parts of the background and other structures.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
