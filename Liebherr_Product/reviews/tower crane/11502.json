The crane on the far right is partially annotated, and the crane in the background on the left is not annotated at all.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of multiple cranes.\n   - The purple bounding box fits well around the crane it is annotating.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single crane.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the red bounding box is too loose and includes parts of multiple cranes.",
