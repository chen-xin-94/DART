Therefore, the precision is not perfect as it does not account for all the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes visible, but only one is annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane appears to be well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
