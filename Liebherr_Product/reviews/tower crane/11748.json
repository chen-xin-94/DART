Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is a visible tower crane on the right side of the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the tower crane on the left side of the image appears to be well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
