In the image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded by buildings. The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated to cover the entire crane structure.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are three visible tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to be well-fitted around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and the overall structure of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
