                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose single tower cranes. The red bounding box (tower crane 0.63) includes parts of two cranes, and the purple bounding box (tower crane 0.70) also includes parts of two cranes. The pink bounding box (tower crane 0.61) is better but still includes parts of the crane on the left.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are covered by the bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted in terms of size, but they do not perfectly isolate individual cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
