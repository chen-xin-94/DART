The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even for partially occluded cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted, not too loose or too tight, and they reasonably enclose the tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
