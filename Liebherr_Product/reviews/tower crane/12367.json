In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled as \"tower crane.\" The bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the individual tower cranes. The red and purple bounding boxes overlap and enclose parts of multiple cranes, which means they do not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably tight around the cranes, but the overlap between the red and purple bounding boxes indicates that they are not well-fitted to individual cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
