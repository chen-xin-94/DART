In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the purple bounding box is slightly off, as it does not fully cover the base of the crane. The red bounding box is more accurate but still slightly loose.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose, and the red bounding box is also a bit loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
