In this image, there are two bounding boxes, each labeled \"tower crane.\" Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one tower crane each. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and are focused on the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the tower cranes. They do not cut off significant parts of the cranes nor include excessive outside areas.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
