In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes, but some of them are not perfectly aligned. For example, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.62\" is slightly off, and the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.54\" is too loose, including parts of another crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes appear to be annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. Some bounding boxes are slightly loose, such as the one labeled \"tower crane 0.54\", which includes parts of another crane, and the one labeled \"tower crane 0.62\", which is slightly off.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
