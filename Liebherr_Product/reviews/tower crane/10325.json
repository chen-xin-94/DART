There are no missing tower cranes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding boxes are slightly loose but not excessively so. They do not cut off significant parts of the cranes, and they do not enclose too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
