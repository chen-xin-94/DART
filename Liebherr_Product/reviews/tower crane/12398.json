The purple bounding box on the left does not fully enclose the tower crane, as it cuts off part of the crane's arm. The red bounding box on the right does enclose the tower crane, but it also includes a significant portion of the background, making it too loose.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box is too tight as it cuts off part of the crane's arm. The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
