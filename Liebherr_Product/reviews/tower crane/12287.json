In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the frame. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and partial visibility.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
