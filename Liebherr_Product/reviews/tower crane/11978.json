However, the bounding box at the bottom of the image does not enclose a tower crane but rather a building. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. However, the second bounding box is incorrect.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the tower crane at the top of the image is reasonably well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
