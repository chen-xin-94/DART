In this image, the red bounding box encloses the lower part of the tower crane and part of the structure it is working on, while the purple bounding box encloses the entire tower crane. Therefore, the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, but the red bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the structure the crane is working on.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
