However, some bounding boxes overlap significantly, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing individual cranes. \n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, and it appears that each one is enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the tower cranes reasonably well, although some might be slightly loose or tight, but not excessively so.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because some bounding boxes overlap significantly, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing individual cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes reasonably well, even if some are slightly loose or tight.",
