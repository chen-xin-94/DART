The crane is well within the bounds of the box, and the box does not include any other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated with a bounding box. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box, so the recall is not correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits the tower crane well. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the entire crane.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
