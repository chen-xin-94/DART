In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes, but the red bounding box on the left side includes multiple cranes, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit well around the cranes, but the red bounding box on the left side is too loose as it includes multiple cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
