Each box contains one single tower crane, and the annotations appear to be accurate even though the cranes are partially occluded by other structures.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional tower cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes being slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
