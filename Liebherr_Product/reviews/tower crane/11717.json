In the image, the bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane\" do enclose the tower cranes, but the bounding box labeled \"tower\" does not. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are multiple tower cranes, and it appears that all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane\" seem to fit well around the tower cranes, but the bounding box labeled \"tower\" is not relevant to the target object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
