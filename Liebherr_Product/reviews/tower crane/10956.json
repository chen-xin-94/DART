The first bounding box (tower crane 0.59) encloses the entire crane, including the base and the arm. The second bounding box (tower crane 0.75) also encloses the entire crane, including the base and the arm. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other tower cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the cranes, including the bases and arms, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
