In this image, the red bounding box (0.54) encloses multiple tower cranes, which is incorrect. The purple bounding box (0.61) also encloses multiple tower cranes. Therefore, neither bounding box perfectly encloses a single tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are within the bounding boxes, so recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. Both bounding boxes are reasonably fit around the tower cranes, but since they enclose multiple cranes, they are not correctly fitted to individual cranes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
