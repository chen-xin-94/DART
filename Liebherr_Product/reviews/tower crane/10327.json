In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual tower cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are more than two tower cranes visible, but only two are annotated. Therefore, the recall is not correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, although the purple box could be slightly tighter. However, it is within acceptable limits.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
