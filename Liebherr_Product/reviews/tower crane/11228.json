In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled as \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although the bounding box on the left (red) is a bit loose and includes some extra area. However, it still reasonably encloses the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, though the leftmost bounding box is slightly loose. The other two bounding boxes fit well around the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
