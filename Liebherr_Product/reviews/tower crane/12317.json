The box is well-aligned with the crane's structure, even though the crane is partially occluded by the bridge. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire crane structure accurately without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
