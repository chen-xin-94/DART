There are three tower cranes, and all three are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box on the left (purple) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box in the middle (red) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box on the right (red) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
