In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes, but the purple bounding box on the left includes parts of the construction site and other cranes. The red bounding box on the right also includes parts of the construction site. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes, but only three are annotated. Therefore, the recall is not perfect.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are somewhat loose, especially the purple and red ones, which include parts of the construction site and other cranes. Therefore, the fit is not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
