The box is well-aligned with the structure of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the tower crane well, with minimal cutting off or enclosing of outside areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
