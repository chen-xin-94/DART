For example, the tower cranes on the right side of the image are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane 0.51\" and \"tower crane 0.65\" fit well around the tower cranes.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" does not fit well as it is misplaced.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose a single tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: One of the bounding boxes is misplaced and does not fit the tower crane accurately.",
