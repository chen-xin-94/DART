It seems to be incorrectly placed at the bottom of the image where there is no tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.70\".\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.70\" fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
