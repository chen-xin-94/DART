In this image, the largest bounding box (purple) correctly encloses the largest tower crane. The middle bounding box (pink) correctly encloses the middle tower crane. The smallest bounding box (red) correctly encloses the smallest tower crane. Therefore, each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they enclose the cranes appropriately.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
