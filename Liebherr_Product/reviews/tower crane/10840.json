The red bounding box covers two of them, and the purple bounding box covers one. However, the third tower crane on the left is not enclosed by any bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it encloses two tower cranes and some additional area.\n   - The purple bounding box is reasonably tight around the single tower crane it encloses.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall** is \"No\" because not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"No\" because the red bounding box is too loose, enclosing more than one tower crane and additional area.",
