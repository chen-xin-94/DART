In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" The red bounding box on the left correctly encloses a single tower crane. The purple bounding box on the right also correctly encloses a single tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left fits well around the tower crane, and the purple bounding box on the right also fits well around the tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
