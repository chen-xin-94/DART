In the image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single tower crane, although some of the bounding boxes overlap with each other. This overlap does not necessarily mean that they are incorrect, as long as each box is focused on a single crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, it appears that all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image seem to fit the tower cranes reasonably well, although some boxes might be slightly loose or tight, they generally cover the cranes adequately.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
