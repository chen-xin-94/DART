The purple bounding box on the right is more precise but still includes a bit of the surrounding area. However, both boxes reasonably enclose the target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are missed.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose but not excessively so. They do not cut off significant parts of the tower cranes and include only a small amount of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
