The bounding box includes parts of the ground and other structures, which means it is not precise.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains at least one tower crane, but the bounding box does not accurately localize it. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including a significant amount of the surrounding area and not tightly fitting the tower crane.",
