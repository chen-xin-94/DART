It only covers a portion of the crane's arm and misses the base and other parts of the structure. Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it does not cover the entire structure of the tower crane. It only covers a part of the crane's arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
