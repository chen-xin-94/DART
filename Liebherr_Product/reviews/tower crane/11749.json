In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded by the building. The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated to include the entire crane structure.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and the cranes' extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
