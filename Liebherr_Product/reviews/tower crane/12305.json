In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the middle bounding box (pink) includes parts of the building and the crane, which is not ideal. The other two bounding boxes (blue and red) seem to enclose the cranes accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The blue and red bounding boxes fit well around the cranes. The pink bounding box is a bit loose as it includes parts of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the middle bounding box includes parts of the building.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes are localized.\n- **Fit**: No, because the middle bounding box is too loose.",
