In the image, the red bounding box on the left does not fully enclose the tower crane, and the purple bounding box on the right is too loose and includes parts of the building.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too tight, cutting off parts of the crane, and the purple bounding box is too loose, including parts of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
