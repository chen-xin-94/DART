There are no multiple objects within a single bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - The image contains multiple tower cranes, and each one appears to be enclosed by a bounding box. No tower cranes seem to be missing a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes even if some parts are slightly cut off or some extra space is included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
