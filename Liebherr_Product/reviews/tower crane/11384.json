In this image, the larger bounding box (purple) correctly encloses the entire tower crane. The smaller bounding box (red) also correctly encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The larger bounding box (purple) fits well around the tower crane, and the smaller bounding box (red) also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
