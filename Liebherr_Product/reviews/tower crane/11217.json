In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although some parts of the cranes are occluded or cut off slightly. This is acceptable based on the suggestion to infer the size of occluded objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are four tower cranes in the image, and all four are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, with only slight cut-offs or slight inclusion of outside areas, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
