It seems to cover the whole structure accurately.\n   - The second bounding box (red) encloses the tower crane on the right side of the image. It also seems to cover the entire structure accurately.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane.\n   - The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
