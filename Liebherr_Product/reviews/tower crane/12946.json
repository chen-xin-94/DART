However, the bounding box labeled \"tower\" does not enclose a tower crane but rather a different structure. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the tower crane is slightly loose but generally acceptable. The bounding box for the \"tower\" is irrelevant for the evaluation of tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
