The purple box encloses the entire crane, including the arm, and the red box does the same for the other crane. Both boxes are inferred correctly even though parts of the cranes are occluded by buildings.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are missed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
