                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the red bounding box on the left does not fully enclose the tower crane, missing parts of the crane's structure. The purple bounding box on the right does a better job but still misses some parts of the crane's structure.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes visible, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left is too loose, and the purple bounding box on the right is slightly loose but more acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
