In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the bounding box on the left includes parts of another crane and some background elements. The bounding box on the right also includes parts of the background. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are slightly loose, including some background elements, but they are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
