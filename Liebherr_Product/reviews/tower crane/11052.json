In this image, the red bounding box encloses one tower crane, but the purple bounding box seems to enclose parts of two tower cranes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by the bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane, but the purple bounding box is too loose and includes parts of another crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
