In this image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single tower crane. The bounding boxes are drawn around the cranes, and even though some parts of the cranes are occluded, the bounding boxes reasonably estimate the size of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation. They are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
