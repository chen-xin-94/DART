The bounding boxes are drawn around the cranes, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded by buildings. The bounding boxes are inferred reasonably well.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the cranes. They are not too loose or too tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
