The box could be more precise by excluding these areas.\n2. **Recall**: There is another tower crane in the background that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, including some areas outside the crane. It could be tighter to better fit the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
