Therefore, the bounding box on the right does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left fits well around the tower crane, but the one on the right is too loose, including unnecessary background space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
