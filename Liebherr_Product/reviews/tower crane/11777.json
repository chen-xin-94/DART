It only encloses a part of one tower crane, missing the rest of the crane's structure.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is partially annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight, as it does not cover the entire structure of the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
