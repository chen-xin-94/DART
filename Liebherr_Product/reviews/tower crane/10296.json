Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are three visible tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated with bounding boxes. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
