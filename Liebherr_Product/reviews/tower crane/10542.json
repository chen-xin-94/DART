For example, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.58\" includes parts of the building and the sky, not just the crane. Similarly, the other bounding boxes also include parts of the buildings or other structures.\n   \n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose as they include significant portions of the buildings and sky, not just the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
