In this image, the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose the tower crane; it is too narrow and does not cover the entire structure. The purple bounding box does enclose a tower crane, but it also includes parts of the building and other structures, making it too loose.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too tight, missing parts of the crane. The purple bounding box is too loose, including parts of the building and other structures.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
