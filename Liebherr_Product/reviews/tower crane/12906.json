The bounding box on the left, however, includes parts of another crane and some additional structures. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the right fits well around the tower crane. The bounding box on the left is too loose as it includes parts of another crane and additional structures.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
