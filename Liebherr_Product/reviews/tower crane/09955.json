Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
