The left bounding box (red) and the right bounding box (purple) both correctly identify and enclose the tower cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes appropriately, with a slight margin that does not significantly cut off the objects or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
