In this image, there are three bounding boxes, each labeled \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box seems to enclose a single tower crane, although the cranes are partially occluded by the bridge structure. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three visible tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and the cranes' structures. The boxes are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
