Each bounding box seems to be correctly identifying a single tower crane without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
