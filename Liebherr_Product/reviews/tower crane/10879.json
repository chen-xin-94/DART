It appears to be correctly enclosing the crane.\n   - The red bounding box encloses the entire tower crane on the left side of the image. It also appears to be correctly enclosing the crane.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane on the right.\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane on the left.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
