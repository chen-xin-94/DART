The first bounding box (purple) encloses the entire structure of the tower crane, and the second bounding box (red) also encloses the entire structure of the second tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
