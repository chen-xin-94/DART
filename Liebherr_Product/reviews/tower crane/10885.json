In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes, but the purple bounding box includes part of another crane's jib. This slightly reduces precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit well around the cranes, though the purple bounding box is a bit loose as it includes part of another crane's jib.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
