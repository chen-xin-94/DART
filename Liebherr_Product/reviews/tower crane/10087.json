However, the red bounding box is too small and does not fully enclose the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are three tower cranes visible in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, but the red bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
