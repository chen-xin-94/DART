The red bounding box includes multiple cranes, and the purple bounding box also includes parts of other cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are several cranes in the image that are not enclosed by any bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose. They enclose multiple cranes and parts of the surrounding area, which is not ideal.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
