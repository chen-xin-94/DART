However, the right bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the building below the crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the right bounding box does not perfectly enclose only the tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: No, because the right bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the building.",
