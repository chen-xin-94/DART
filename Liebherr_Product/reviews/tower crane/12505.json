However, the bounding box on the left (with a score of 0.69) is too loose and includes parts of the building. The other two bounding boxes are more precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left is too loose, as it includes parts of the building. The other two bounding boxes fit well around the tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
