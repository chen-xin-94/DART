However, they do not enclose multiple objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are somewhat loose. The red bounding box includes extra space, and the purple bounding box includes part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
