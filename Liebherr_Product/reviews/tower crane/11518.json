However, it also includes parts of the building and other structures at the bottom, which is not ideal.\n   - The purple bounding box (tower crane 0.64) also encloses a single tower crane but includes some parts of the background and other structures.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are no other tower cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is a bit loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures at the bottom.\n   - The purple bounding box is also a bit loose as it includes parts of the background and other structures.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes include parts of other structures and background.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are too loose and include unnecessary parts.",
