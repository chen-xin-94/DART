There is no significant overlap with other objects, and the bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, all visible tower cranes are annotated with bounding boxes. There are no missed tower cranes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes without significant portions being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
