The purple bounding box is also too narrow and does not cover the entire structure of the crane. Therefore, the precision is not satisfactory.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is satisfactory.\n\n3. **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are too narrow and do not fit the entire structure of the tower cranes. They are too tight and do not cover the full width of the cranes. Therefore, the fit is not satisfactory.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
