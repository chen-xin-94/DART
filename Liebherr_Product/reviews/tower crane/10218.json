It includes parts of the stadium structure and does not accurately localize the crane.\n   - The purple bounding box on the right does enclose a single tower crane, but it also includes parts of the stadium structure.\n   \n2. **Recall**: \n   - There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the stadium structure.\n   - The purple bounding box is also too loose as it includes parts of the stadium structure.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
