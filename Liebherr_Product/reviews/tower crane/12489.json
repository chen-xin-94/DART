In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled as \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to be well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
