In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the purple bounding box includes parts of the other cranes and some background elements. The red bounding box is more precise but still includes some background elements.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three visible tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated with bounding boxes. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is relatively well-fitted, but the purple bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of other cranes and background elements.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
