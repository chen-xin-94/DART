The bounding boxes do not cover all the tower cranes present in the image.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The purple bounding box also fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Precision**: Both bounding boxes accurately enclose single tower cranes.\n- **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: Both bounding boxes fit well around the tower cranes.",
