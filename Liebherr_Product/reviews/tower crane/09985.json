In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box on the right seems to include parts of another crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, though the red bounding box on the right is slightly loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
