The annotations are reasonably accurate, even for the occluded parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
