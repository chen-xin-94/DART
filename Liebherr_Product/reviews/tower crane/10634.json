In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the purple bounding box on the right side is not enclosing a single tower crane perfectly. It includes parts of other structures and cranes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is good.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the purple bounding box on the right side is too loose as it includes parts of other structures and cranes. The other bounding boxes seem to fit well.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
