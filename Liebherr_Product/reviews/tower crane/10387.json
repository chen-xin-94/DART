There are three tower cranes, and all three are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The first bounding box (red) fits well around the tower crane, not too loose or too tight.\n   - The second bounding box (purple) fits well around the tower crane, not too loose or too tight.\n   - The third bounding box (pink) fits well around the tower crane, not too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
