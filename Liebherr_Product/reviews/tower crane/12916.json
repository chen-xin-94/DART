The boxes are drawn around the cranes, and even though parts of the cranes might be occluded or partially outside the box, the main structure is well captured.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no cranes left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes adequately without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
