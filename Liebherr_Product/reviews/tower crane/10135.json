Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify and enclose the tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit well around the tower cranes, with a reasonable margin that neither cuts off parts of the cranes nor includes too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
