Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box (purple) is slightly loose as it includes part of another crane.\n   - The second bounding box (red) is too loose as it encloses multiple cranes and a lot of surrounding area.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose single target objects.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are either too loose or include multiple objects.",
