However, the red bounding box does not enclose a tower crane; it seems to be misplaced and does not correspond to any visible tower crane in the image.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There is only one visible tower crane in the image, and it is correctly localized by the purple bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the red bounding box does not correctly enclose a tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because the only visible tower crane is localized by the purple bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane.",
