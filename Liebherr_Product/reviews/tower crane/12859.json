The bounding box should cover the entire structure of the crane, including the long horizontal arm. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and only covers a small part of the crane. It should be extended to cover the entire crane structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
