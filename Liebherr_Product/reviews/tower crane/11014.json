However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" also includes parts of another crane, which affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are three visible tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, though the box labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" includes parts of another crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" is slightly loose and includes parts of another crane.",
