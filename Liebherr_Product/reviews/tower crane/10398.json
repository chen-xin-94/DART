In this image, the bounding boxes labeled \"tower\" are enclosing parts of buildings rather than the tower crane. Therefore, the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one tower crane, but none of the bounding boxes correctly localize it. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Since the bounding boxes do not enclose the correct target object, the fit criterion is not applicable here.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
