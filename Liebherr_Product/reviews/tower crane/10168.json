The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded or extend beyond the image boundaries.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes well, with only slight cutting off or enclosing of outside areas, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
