In this image, the red bounding box encloses one tower crane, and the purple bounding box encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
