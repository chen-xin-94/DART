The first bounding box (purple) encloses the entire structure of the first tower crane, and the second bounding box (red) encloses the second tower crane. Both boxes are correctly placed around the target objects without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, capturing the entire structure without significant parts being cut off or excessive empty space around the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
