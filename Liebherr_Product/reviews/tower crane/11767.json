Each bounding box contains one single tower crane, and the occlusion is reasonably estimated.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit the tower cranes well, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
