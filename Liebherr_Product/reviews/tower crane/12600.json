In the image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single tower crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded by the buildings. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are five tower cranes in the image, and all of them are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and visibility.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
