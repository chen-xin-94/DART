The leftmost bounding box (purple) encloses multiple cranes, and the middle and rightmost bounding boxes (red) also enclose multiple cranes. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are several tower cranes that are not enclosed by any bounding box. Therefore, the recall is not met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose as they enclose multiple cranes and a lot of surrounding area. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
