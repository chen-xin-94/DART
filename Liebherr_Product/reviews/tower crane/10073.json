Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box is slightly loose, but it is acceptable. The red bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the construction site below the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
