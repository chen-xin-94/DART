In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the bounding box on the left (labeled \"tower crane 0.52\") also includes part of a building, which is not part of the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is perfect.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the leftmost bounding box includes part of a building, making it too loose. The other two bounding boxes fit well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
