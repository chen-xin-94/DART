Both bounding boxes correctly identify and enclose the tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the tower cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
