In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even though parts of the cranes are occluded by the building. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and the cranes' extended parts. The boxes are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
