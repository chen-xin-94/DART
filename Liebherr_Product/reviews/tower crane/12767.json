For example, the purple bounding box on the left is slightly off, and the orange bounding box on the right is too loose.\n   \n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - It appears that all visible tower cranes in the image are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - Some bounding boxes are slightly loose, such as the orange one on the right and the purple one on the left. However, they are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because some bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the tower cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because some bounding boxes are slightly too loose.",
