The crane is partially occluded by the construction site, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size. Therefore, the bounding box does perfectly enclose one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple tower cranes, but only one is annotated with a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It reasonably fits the tower crane, considering the occlusion and the visible parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
