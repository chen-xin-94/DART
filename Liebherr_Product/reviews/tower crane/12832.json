Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose the target object (tower crane).\n2. **Recall**: There is a tower crane in the image, but it is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the helicopter, but since the target object is a tower crane, this criterion is not applicable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
