In this image, the bounding boxes are drawn around parts of the tower cranes, but not the entire structures. The bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the entire tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are too tight as they only cover parts of the tower cranes rather than the entire structures.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
