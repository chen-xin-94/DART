The crane is partially occluded by the building, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size.\n   - The purple bounding box also encloses a single tower crane. The crane is fully visible within the bounding box.\n   - Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose, including some extra area around the crane, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - The purple bounding box fits well around the crane, with minimal extra space and no significant parts of the crane cut off.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
