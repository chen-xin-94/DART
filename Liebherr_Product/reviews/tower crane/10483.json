There are no other tower cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area.\n   - The red bounding box is too tight as it cuts off parts of the crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
