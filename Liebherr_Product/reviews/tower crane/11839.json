The purple bounding box encloses the green tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the yellow tower crane. The bounding boxes are correctly identifying the target objects without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes well, with slight allowances for the crane arms and bases, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
