                "content": "1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane\". Each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although the bounding box on the right (0.56) is slightly loose and includes some extra space. However, it still reasonably encloses the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left (0.61) fits well around the tower crane. The bounding box on the right (0.56) is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
