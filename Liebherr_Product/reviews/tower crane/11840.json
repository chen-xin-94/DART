In this image, the purple bounding box (left) and the red bounding box (right) each enclose a single tower crane. However, the red bounding box (right) also includes part of the crane in the middle, which is not ideal.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box (left) and the red bounding box (right) are slightly loose, but they are acceptable. The middle bounding box (green) fits well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the red bounding box (right) includes part of the middle crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, the bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, though slightly loose.",
