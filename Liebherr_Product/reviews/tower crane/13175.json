There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The purple bounding box (0.73) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The red bounding box (0.59) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The pink bounding box (0.59) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The orange bounding box (0.59) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The orange bounding box (0.59) on the right fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
