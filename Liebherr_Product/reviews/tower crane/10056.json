Instead, it encompasses multiple cranes and other parts of the image.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a large portion of the surrounding area and not just the tower cranes.",
