The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and seem to be correctly identifying the cranes. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is good.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit well around the tower cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off significant parts of the cranes or include too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is good.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
