The bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably estimate the size of the cranes, even if parts are occluded.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
