In the image, each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the bounding box. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are three visible tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and partial visibility.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
