                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the red bounding box encloses one tower crane accurately. The pink bounding box also encloses one tower crane, but it overlaps with the red bounding box. The purple bounding box encloses another tower crane accurately. Therefore, each bounding box encloses one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane. The pink bounding box is slightly loose but still acceptable. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
