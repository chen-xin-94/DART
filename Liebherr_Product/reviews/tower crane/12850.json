The annotations are accurate in terms of identifying the target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are missed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
