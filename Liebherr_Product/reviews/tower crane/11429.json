However, the bounding box on the left (purple) includes some parts of the building and the bounding box in the middle (red) includes some parts of the building as well. The bounding box on the right (orange) is correctly enclosing the tower crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left (purple) is slightly loose as it includes parts of the building. The bounding box in the middle (red) is also slightly loose as it includes parts of the building. The bounding box on the right (orange) fits well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes on the left and middle include parts of the building.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes are localized.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes on the left and middle are slightly loose.",
