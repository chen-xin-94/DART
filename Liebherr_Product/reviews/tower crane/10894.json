This means it does not perfectly enclose just the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane visible in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly too loose as it includes part of the building. It should be adjusted to fit the tower crane more precisely.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
