It includes multiple tower cranes and parts of the surrounding structures.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes a lot of the surrounding area and other objects, not just the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
