The bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit the tower cranes well, with minimal extra space and no significant parts of the cranes being cut off.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
