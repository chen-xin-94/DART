The crane is well within the bounds of the box, and the box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top and bottom, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the entire crane without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
