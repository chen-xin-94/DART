However, it does not perfectly enclose the entire crane, as parts of the crane are outside the bounding box. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane and does not fully enclose the entire crane structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
