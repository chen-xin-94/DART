The bounding boxes do not include any other objects, so they are precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the tower cranes well, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
