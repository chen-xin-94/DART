In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled as \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit well around the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes, even considering occlusions.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
