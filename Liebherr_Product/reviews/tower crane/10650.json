Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are several other tower cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane seems to be a good fit, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
