Therefore, not all tower cranes are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The red bounding box is slightly tight as it cuts off parts of the crane's arm.\n   - The purple bounding box seems to fit well, enclosing the entire structure of the tower crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the red bounding box is slightly tight and cuts off parts of the crane's arm.",
