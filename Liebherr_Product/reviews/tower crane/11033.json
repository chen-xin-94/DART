Specifically, there are at least two more visible tower cranes in the background that are not enclosed by any bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose but generally fits the tower crane well.\n   - The purple bounding box on the right is also slightly loose but generally fits the tower crane well.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single tower crane each.\n- **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are slightly loose but generally fit the tower cranes well.",
