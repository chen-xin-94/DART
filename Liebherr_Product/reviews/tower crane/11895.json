The bounding boxes are too loose and include parts of other objects or background. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes visible, but only three are annotated. Therefore, the recall is not perfect.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose, including significant portions of the background and other objects. Therefore, the fit is not perfect.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
