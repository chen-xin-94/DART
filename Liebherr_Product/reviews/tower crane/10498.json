Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple tower cranes, but only one bounding box is drawn. Hence, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of extra space and other objects besides the tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
