In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box includes parts of another crane and some additional structures. Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the crane, but the red bounding box is too loose as it includes additional structures and parts of another crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
