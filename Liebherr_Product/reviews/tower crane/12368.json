However, the bounding boxes are not perfectly enclosing the individual tower cranes. Instead, they are enclosing multiple cranes together. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed within the bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose as they enclose multiple cranes and a significant amount of the surrounding area. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
