                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. The purple bounding box correctly encloses the entire tower crane on the left. The red bounding box encloses the tower crane on the right, but it also includes part of the building. However, given the occlusion and the need to estimate the size, this is acceptable.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. Both tower cranes in the image are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane on the left. The red bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the building, but it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
