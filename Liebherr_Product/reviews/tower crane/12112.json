Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box (tower crane 0.58) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The purple bounding box (tower crane 0.59) also fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
