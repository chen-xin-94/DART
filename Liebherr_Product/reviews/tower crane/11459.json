However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.68\" includes parts of another crane, which affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the \"tower crane 0.68\" box is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
