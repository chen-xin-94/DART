However, the bounding box on the right incorrectly labels a structure that is not a tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
