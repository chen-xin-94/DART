                "content": "1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single tower crane. In the image, the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the tower cranes. For example, the bounding box on the left (purple) includes part of the building and the bounding box in the middle (red) includes part of the building as well. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are not fitting well. They are too loose and include parts of the buildings, which means they are not accurately fitting the tower cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
