Some bounding boxes are too tight, cutting off parts of the cranes, and some are too loose, including parts of the background or other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are multiple tower cranes in the image, and not all of them are annotated. For example, the crane on the far right is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes are not well-fitted. Some are too tight, cutting off parts of the cranes, and some are too loose, including unnecessary background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: The bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the tower cranes.\n- **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: The bounding boxes are either too tight or too loose, not fitting the cranes properly.",
