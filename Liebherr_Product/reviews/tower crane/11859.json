The purple bounding box on the right also correctly encloses one tower crane. Both bounding boxes are precise in identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated with bounding boxes. The middle tower crane is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose but acceptable. The purple bounding box on the right is also slightly loose but acceptable. Both bounding boxes fit reasonably well.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
