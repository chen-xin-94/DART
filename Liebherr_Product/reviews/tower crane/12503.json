Each bounding box contains one single tower crane, and the boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded by other structures.\n2. **Recall**: There are more tower cranes in the image that are not annotated. The image contains at least four tower cranes, but only two are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit the tower cranes well, considering the occlusions and the overall size of the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
