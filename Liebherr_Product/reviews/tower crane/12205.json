Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one bounding box, but there are multiple tower cranes in the image. Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose, including parts of another crane and some background elements. It is not a perfect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
