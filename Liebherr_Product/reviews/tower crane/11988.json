The bounding box on the right side of the image also encloses one single tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight.
