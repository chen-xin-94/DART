The left bounding box (purple) encloses the entire structure of the tower crane, and the right bounding box (red) does the same. Both boxes are correctly identifying single tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes well, with slight allowances for the structure's extensions, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
