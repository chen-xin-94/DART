Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose just the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one other tower crane visible in the image (to the left of the annotated one) that is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight at the bottom, cutting off part of the crane's base, and it includes parts of the building, making it not a perfect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
