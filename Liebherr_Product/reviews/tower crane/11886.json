It includes multiple tower cranes within the same bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the group of tower cranes it encloses, but since it includes multiple cranes, it does not fit the requirement of enclosing a single target object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
