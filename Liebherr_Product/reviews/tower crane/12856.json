In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but they also include parts of the building and other structures. This means the bounding boxes are not perfectly enclosing just the tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are somewhat loose as they include parts of the buildings and other structures, but they do cover the entirety of the tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
