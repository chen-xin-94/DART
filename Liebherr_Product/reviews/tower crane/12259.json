In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the purple bounding box (top-left) includes parts of the building and the sky, which means it is not perfectly enclosing just the tower crane. The other bounding boxes seem to be more precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the building and the sky. The other bounding boxes seem to fit well, although the red bounding box (bottom-right) is slightly tight but still acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
