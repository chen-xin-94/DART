However, the purple bounding box encloses two tower cranes, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both tower cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the smaller tower crane. The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes both tower cranes and a lot of extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
