The box is well-placed around the crane, including its full structure.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the tower crane, capturing its entire structure without significant excess space or cutting off parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
