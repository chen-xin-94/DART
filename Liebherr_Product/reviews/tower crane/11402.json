The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three visible tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and reasonable estimation of the crane's size.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
