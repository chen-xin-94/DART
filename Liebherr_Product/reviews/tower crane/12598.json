However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.52\" does not enclose a tower crane; it seems to be incorrectly placed over a different structure. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. However, the additional incorrect bounding box does not affect the recall.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the main tower crane is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight. The incorrect bounding box does not affect the fit of the correct bounding box.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
