This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box seems to fit well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The red bounding box also seems to fit well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"Yes\" because each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall** is \"No\" because not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"Yes\" because each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.",
