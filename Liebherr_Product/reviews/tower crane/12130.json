Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes parts of other objects. The purple bounding box is better but still includes some extra space.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
