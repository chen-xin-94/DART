Both bounding boxes correctly identify and enclose one tower crane each.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by the bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra area around the tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
