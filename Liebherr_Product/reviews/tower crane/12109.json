In the image, each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the bounding box. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are multiple tower cranes, and all of them are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and partial visibility. They are neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
