The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes a bit of the background.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the tree and the building. The purple bounding box is slightly better but still includes some background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
