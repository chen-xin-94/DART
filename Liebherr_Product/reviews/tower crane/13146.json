In this image, the bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" and \"tower crane 0.65\" do not perfectly enclose a single tower crane. They include parts of wind turbines. The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.72\" correctly encloses a single tower crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane 0.55\" and \"tower crane 0.65\" are too loose as they include parts of wind turbines. The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.72\" fits well.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
