The purple bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane, but it is not excessively loose. The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the crane. Both bounding boxes are acceptable in terms of fit.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
