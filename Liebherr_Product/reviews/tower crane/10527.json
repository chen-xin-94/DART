Both bounding boxes accurately enclose one tower crane each, without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for the structure's extensions.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
