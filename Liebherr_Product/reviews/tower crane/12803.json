The entire structure of the crane, including the boom and the tower, is within the bounding box. There is no significant part of the crane outside the bounding box, and no other objects are included within the box.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It encloses the entire crane structure without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
