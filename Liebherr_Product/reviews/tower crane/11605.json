The purple bounding box on the right is more accurate but still includes a small part of the building. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one on the left, which includes parts of the building and the crane's base. The purple bounding box on the right is better but still includes a small part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
