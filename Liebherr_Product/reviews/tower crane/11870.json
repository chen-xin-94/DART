In the image, the bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane\" do enclose the tower cranes, but the one on the left also includes a person, which is not part of the tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the tower cranes reasonably well, although the one on the left includes a person, which makes it slightly loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box on the left includes a person.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are localized.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding box on the left is too loose, including a person.",
