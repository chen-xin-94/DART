Both bounding boxes correctly enclose the respective tower cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
