The box on the right is more precise but still includes a bit of extra space. However, both boxes do enclose the target objects reasonably well.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose but not excessively so. They are generally well-fitted to the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
