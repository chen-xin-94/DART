The purple bounding box encloses a single tower crane arm, and the red bounding box encloses a single tower crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the crane arm, and the red bounding box fits well around the tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
