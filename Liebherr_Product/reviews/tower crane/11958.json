Therefore, we cannot assess whether each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: Are all target objects localized by a bounding box?\n   - Since there are no bounding boxes present in the image, none of the tower cranes are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Is each bounding box neither too loose nor too tight?\n   - Again, without any bounding boxes present, we cannot evaluate the fit.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No bounding boxes are present to evaluate precision.\n- **Recall**: No bounding boxes are present, so no tower cranes are localized.\n- **Fit**: No bounding boxes are present to evaluate the fit.",
