Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box (purple) fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The second bounding box (red) is too loose as it encloses multiple tower cranes and a lot of extra space.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because the second bounding box does not enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall** is \"No\" because not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"No\" because the second bounding box is too loose and includes multiple cranes.",
