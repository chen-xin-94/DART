It includes parts of the sky and other elements that are not part of the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes a significant amount of the surrounding area that is not part of the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
