The box is drawn around the entire structure of the crane, including the jib and the tower.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the tower crane, capturing the entire structure without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
