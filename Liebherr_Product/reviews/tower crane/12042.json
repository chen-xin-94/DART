The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the tower cranes well, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
