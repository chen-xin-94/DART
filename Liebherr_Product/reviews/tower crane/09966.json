The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and seem to be correctly identifying the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for the structure's extensions.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
