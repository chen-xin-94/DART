The red bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the building and other objects. The purple bounding box is also too loose and includes parts of the building and other cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose. They enclose a significant amount of the surrounding area, including parts of the buildings and other cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
