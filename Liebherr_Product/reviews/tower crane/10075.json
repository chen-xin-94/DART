The red bounding box also correctly encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, although it includes a bit of the surrounding area, it is not excessively loose. The red bounding box also fits well around the second tower crane, with a slight inclusion of the surrounding area but not excessively loose.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
