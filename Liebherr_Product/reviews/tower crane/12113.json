The one on the right (red) also includes some extra space around the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the one on the right (red), which includes extra space around the crane. The one on the left (purple) also includes part of the building structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
