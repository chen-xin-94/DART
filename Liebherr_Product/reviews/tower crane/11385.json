In this image, the purple bounding box encloses the entire tower crane, while the red bounding box encloses a smaller portion of another tower crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose single tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the entire tower crane. The red bounding box is also reasonably tight around the smaller tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
