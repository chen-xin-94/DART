                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single tower crane. In the image, the purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box on the right each enclose a single tower crane. However, the purple bounding box on the left also includes part of another crane in the background, which affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. The purple bounding box on the left is slightly loose, but it is not excessively so. The red bounding box on the right fits well.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
