The purple bounding box on the right is also too small and does not cover the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes in the image, but only two are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too tight and do not fit the cranes properly. They cut off significant parts of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
