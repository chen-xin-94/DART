The purple bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes correctly identify and enclose a single tower crane each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the left tower crane. The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are acceptable in terms of fit.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
