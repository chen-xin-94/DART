                "content": "1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose one tower crane each. The red bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose at the bottom, but it still reasonably encloses the entire tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose at the bottom but still reasonably encloses the entire tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
