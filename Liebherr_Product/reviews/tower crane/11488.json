There are three tower cranes, and each has a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The first bounding box (red, top-left) is slightly loose but acceptable.\n   - The second bounding box (purple, middle) is slightly loose but acceptable.\n   - The third bounding box (red, bottom-right) is slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
