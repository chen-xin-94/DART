This means the bounding box is not perfectly precise.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane and some extra space around the target crane. It could be tighter to better fit the single tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
