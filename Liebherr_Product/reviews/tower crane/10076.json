The red bounding box, however, includes parts of the structure that are not part of the tower crane, making it less precise.\n2. **Recall**: Both tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane. The red bounding box is too loose, including parts of the structure that are not part of the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
