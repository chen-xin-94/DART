In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" The first bounding box on the left correctly encloses a single tower crane. The second bounding box in the middle also correctly encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes without significant portions being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
