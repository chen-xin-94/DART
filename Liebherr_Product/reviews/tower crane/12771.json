For example, there are visible tower cranes to the left and right of the annotated ones.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red and purple bounding boxes are slightly loose as they include parts of the construction site below the cranes.\n   - The blue bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the tower crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the tower cranes and include parts of the construction site.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are either too loose or too tight.",
