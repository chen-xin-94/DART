The bounding box should cover the entire structure of the crane, including the jib and the counterweights. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and only covers a part of the tower crane. It should be adjusted to fit the entire crane structure.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
