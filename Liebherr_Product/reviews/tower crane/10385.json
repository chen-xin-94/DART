The purple bounding box on the right also includes parts of the building and the crane's arm is cut off. Therefore, the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose as they include parts of the building and cut off parts of the cranes.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
