The one on the right is more precise but still includes a bit of the building. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the one on the left, which includes part of the building. The one on the right is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
