This reduces the precision.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. This reduces the recall.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, including parts of other structures and not tightly fitting the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
