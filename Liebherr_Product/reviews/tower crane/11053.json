It only captures a part of the crane, specifically the vertical section, and misses the horizontal arm. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one bounding box, but there are multiple tower cranes visible in the image. Hence, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it does not cover the entire structure of the tower crane, particularly the horizontal arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
