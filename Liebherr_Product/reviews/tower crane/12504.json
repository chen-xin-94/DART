However, the bounding boxes are not perfectly aligned with the cranes, and some parts of the cranes are outside the boxes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, it appears that all visible tower cranes are annotated with bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is good.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are somewhat loose, as they include a significant amount of background and do not tightly fit the cranes. However, they are not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
