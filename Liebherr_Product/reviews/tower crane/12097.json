For example, the tower crane on the far left is not enclosed by any bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it encloses multiple cranes.\n   - The pink bounding box is also too loose for the same reason.\n   - The purple bounding box seems to fit the single tower crane well.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose single target objects.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are too loose and enclose multiple objects.",
