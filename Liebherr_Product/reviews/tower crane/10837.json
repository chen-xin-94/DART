There are two tower cranes, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane.\n   - The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
