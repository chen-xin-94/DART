The bounding boxes do not overlap multiple cranes or other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and reasonable estimations of the cranes' sizes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
