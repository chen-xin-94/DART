However, it also includes parts of the bridge and other structures, which means it is not perfectly enclosing just the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the bridge and other structures. It could be tighter to better fit the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
