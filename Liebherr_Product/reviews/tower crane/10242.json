The bounding box on the right, however, does not enclose a tower crane but rather a part of the landscape. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. However, the second bounding box is incorrect and does not contribute to recall.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the right does not fit any tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
