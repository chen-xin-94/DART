The bounding boxes are drawn around the cranes, and even though some parts of the cranes are occluded by trees or other structures, the bounding boxes reasonably estimate the size of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
