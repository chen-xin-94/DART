It includes parts of the construction site and other structures, not just the tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated with a bounding box. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the construction site and other structures. It does not fit the tower crane tightly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
