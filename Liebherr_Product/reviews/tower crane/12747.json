The left bounding box (red) correctly encloses the tower crane, but the right bounding box (purple) includes some extra structures at the bottom. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The left bounding box (red) fits well around the tower crane. The right bounding box (purple) is slightly loose as it includes some extra structures at the bottom.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
