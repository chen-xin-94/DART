In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual tower cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the tower cranes, with a slight allowance for the crane's structure. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
