It only captures part of the crane and includes parts of the background.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image. The purple bounding box correctly localizes one of them, but the red bounding box does not accurately localize the second crane.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The red bounding box is too loose and does not fit the tower crane properly.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: The red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Not all target objects (tower cranes) are accurately localized by the bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose and does not fit the tower crane properly.",
