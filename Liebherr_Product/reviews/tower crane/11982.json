The purple bounding box accurately encloses the tower crane on the left, and the red bounding box accurately encloses the tower crane on the right. There is no significant occlusion that would affect the precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box slightly cuts off the top of the crane, but this is within acceptable limits. The red bounding box also fits well around the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
