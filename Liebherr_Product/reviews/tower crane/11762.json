In this image, each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly and are focused on the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are four tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the bounding box.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
