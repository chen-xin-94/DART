In this image, the purple bounding box on the left correctly encloses a single tower crane. The red bounding box in the center also correctly encloses a single tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are more tower cranes visible in the background that are not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box in the center both fit well around the tower cranes, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
