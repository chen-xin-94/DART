The purple bounding box is more accurate but still includes some extra space around the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the building and the base of the crane. The purple bounding box is slightly better but still includes some extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
