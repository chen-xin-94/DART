The boxes are drawn around the cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with slight allowances for the crane's structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
