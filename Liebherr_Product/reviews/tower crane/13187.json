The box includes the entire structure of the crane, even though part of it is occluded by the building in the background. This is acceptable as the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It encloses the entire crane without cutting off any significant parts or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
