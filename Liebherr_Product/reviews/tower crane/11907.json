However, they do enclose the main parts of the tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: There are more tower cranes in the image that are not annotated. Only two out of several visible tower cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the one on the left (purple), which includes part of the building. The one on the right (red) also includes some background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
