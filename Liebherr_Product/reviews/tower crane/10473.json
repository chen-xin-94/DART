The right bounding box (red) also encloses the entire crane. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by the bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
