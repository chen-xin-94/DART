The first bounding box (left) encloses the entire crane, including the base and the arm. The second bounding box (right) also encloses the entire crane, including the base and the arm. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
