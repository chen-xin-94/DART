For example, the purple bounding box on the left includes parts of the building and other objects, and the red bounding box on the right includes parts of the building and other cranes. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose, as they include significant portions of the surrounding environment and other objects. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
