In this image, there are two bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" The first bounding box (purple) encloses the top part of a tower crane, and the second bounding box (red) encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane. The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
