However, it also includes some parts of the background and other structures, which slightly reduces precision.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some parts of the background and other structures.
