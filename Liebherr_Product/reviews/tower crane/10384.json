                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane. The purple bounding box encloses the entire tower crane on the left, and the red bounding box encloses the entire tower crane on the right. \n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it still reasonably encloses the entire tower crane. The red bounding box is also slightly loose at the top, but it reasonably encloses the entire tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
