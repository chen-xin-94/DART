Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose just the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a large portion of the bridge and other elements, not just the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
