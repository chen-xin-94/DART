The crane is partially occluded by other structures, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size. Therefore, the bounding box does enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated with a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It reasonably fits the visible part of the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
