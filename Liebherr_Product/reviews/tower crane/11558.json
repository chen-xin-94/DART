Specifically, there are at least three more tower cranes visible in the background that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, although some parts of the cranes are slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.",
