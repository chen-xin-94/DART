It includes multiple tower cranes and parts of the construction site.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes a large area outside the target object and does not accurately fit any single tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
