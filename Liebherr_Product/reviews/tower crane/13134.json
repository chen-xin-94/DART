It includes parts of the sky and the structure below the crane.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower\" on the left side of the image is too small and does not fully enclose the tower crane.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane\" on the right side of the image is also too small and does not fully enclose the tower crane.\n   \n2. **Recall**: \n   - There are three tower cranes in the image, but none of them are correctly localized by a bounding box. The existing bounding boxes do not accurately capture the full extent of any of the tower cranes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding boxes are either too loose (including unnecessary parts of the image) or too tight (cutting off parts of the tower cranes). None of the bounding boxes fit the tower cranes properly.",
