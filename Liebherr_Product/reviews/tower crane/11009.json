The red bounding box encloses a single tower crane accurately. The purple bounding box also encloses a single tower crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane, and the purple bounding box also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
