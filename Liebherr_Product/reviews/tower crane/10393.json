The purple bounding box includes multiple tower cranes, and the red bounding box also includes parts of multiple cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are several cranes in the background that are not enclosed by any bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose as they enclose multiple cranes and parts of cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
