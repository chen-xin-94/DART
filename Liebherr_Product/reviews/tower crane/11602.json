The first bounding box on the left perfectly encloses the tower crane, and the second bounding box on the right also encloses the tower crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They accurately enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
