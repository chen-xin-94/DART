In this image, both bounding boxes enclose the tower cranes accurately without including other objects. The bounding boxes are inferred correctly even though parts of the cranes are occluded by other structures.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image fit well around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and extensions.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
