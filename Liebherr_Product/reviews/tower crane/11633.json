In this image, there are three bounding boxes, each labeled as \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the frame. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes based on the visible parts.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
