                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the red bounding box correctly encloses the left tower crane, and the purple bounding box correctly encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the left tower crane, and the purple bounding box fits well around the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
