Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n   - The second bounding box (purple) encloses a tower crane. It correctly identifies the target object.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the second bounding box (purple).\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The second bounding box (purple) is slightly loose but reasonably encloses the tower crane. It is not too tight or too loose.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
