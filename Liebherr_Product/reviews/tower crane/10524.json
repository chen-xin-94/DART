The red and pink bounding boxes enclose parts of multiple cranes, and the purple bounding box is too loose, including parts of the background and other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red and pink bounding boxes are too loose, including parts of multiple cranes and background. The purple bounding box is also too loose, including parts of the background and other objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
