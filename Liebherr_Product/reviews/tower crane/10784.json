The bounding boxes do not include other objects and are focused on the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they enclose the cranes appropriately.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
