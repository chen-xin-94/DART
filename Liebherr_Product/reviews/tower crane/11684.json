Each box contains one tower crane, and there is no significant overlap with other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are four visible tower cranes in the image, and all four are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
