In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded by the buildings. The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are annotated with bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and reasonable estimations of the cranes' sizes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
