However, given the complexity of the scene, this is acceptable.\n2. **Recall**: There is another tower crane in the background that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably encloses the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
