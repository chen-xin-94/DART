Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are at least three tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane is reasonably well-fitted. It encloses the crane without being too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
