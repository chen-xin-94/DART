However, the bounding box on the left does not enclose a tower crane; it seems to be incorrectly labeled as a tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes. However, one of the bounding boxes is incorrectly labeled.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the right fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left does not fit a tower crane at all.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
