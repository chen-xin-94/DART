In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box also includes part of the building and the base of the crane, which is not ideal. The purple bounding box is more accurate in enclosing the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is a bit loose as it includes part of the building. The purple bounding box is a better fit for the crane it encloses.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
