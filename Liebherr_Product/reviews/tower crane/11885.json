This does not meet the precision requirement.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present. This means not all tower cranes are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box is too loose as it encloses multiple tower cranes and a large area around them.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: The bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, enclosing multiple cranes and extra area.",
