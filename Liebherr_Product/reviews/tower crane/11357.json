                "content": "1. **Precision**: The image shows two bounding boxes around two tower cranes. Each bounding box encloses a single tower crane. The bounding boxes seem to be correctly placed around the cranes, even though the cranes are partially occluded by other objects. The bounding boxes are inferred based on a reasonable estimation of the cranes' sizes.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
