The red bounding box also correctly encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane. The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
