However, the bounding boxes also include parts of the buildings and other structures, which means they are not perfectly enclosing just the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are somewhat loose as they include parts of the buildings and other structures, but they do cover the entire tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
