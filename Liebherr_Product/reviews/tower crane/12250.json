The annotations are clear and distinct, with no overlap or inclusion of non-target objects.\n2. **Recall:** All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes, and each one is annotated.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes, even if some parts are slightly cut off or some extra space is included.",
