In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the frame. The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated to include the entire crane structure.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and parts of the cranes that extend outside the frame. The fit is appropriate and not overly tight or loose.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
