It is too small and only covers a part of the base of one crane, missing the rest of the structure.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire tower crane, making it an incorrect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
