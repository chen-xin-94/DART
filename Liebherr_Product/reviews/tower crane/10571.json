Instead, it encompasses multiple tower cranes and parts of the buildings.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a large area around the tower cranes and parts of the buildings, rather than tightly fitting around a single tower crane.",
