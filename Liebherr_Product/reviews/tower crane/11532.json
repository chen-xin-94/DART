Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes visible, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane appears to be well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
