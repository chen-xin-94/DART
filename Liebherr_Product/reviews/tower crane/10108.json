There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn around a portion of the image that includes parts of multiple cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the area it covers, but it does not accurately fit a single tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
