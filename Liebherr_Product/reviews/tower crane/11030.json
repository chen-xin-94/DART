The right bounding box (red) encloses a different type of crane, not a tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are two cranes in the image, but only one is a tower crane. The left bounding box correctly identifies the tower crane, so recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The left bounding box (purple) fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight. The right bounding box (red) is irrelevant for the evaluation of the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
