In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the purple bounding box encloses multiple cranes, which is not ideal. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the cranes reasonably well, although the purple bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
