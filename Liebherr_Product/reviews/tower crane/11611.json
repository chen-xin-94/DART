Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Both bounding boxes fit their respective tower cranes well. They are neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
