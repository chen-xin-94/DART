In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box on the right seems to include part of the building and the trees, which is not ideal. The other two bounding boxes seem to be more accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the right is too loose as it includes parts of the building and trees. The other two bounding boxes seem to fit the tower cranes reasonably well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
