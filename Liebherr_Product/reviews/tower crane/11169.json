The purple bounding box encloses one tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses another tower crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane. The red bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the tower crane. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
