It only captures a part of the crane, specifically the vertical section, and misses the horizontal arm.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it only captures a part of the crane and does not include the entire structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
