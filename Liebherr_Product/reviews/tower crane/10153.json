However, the bounding box labeled \"tower 0.51\" does not enclose a tower crane but rather a different type of construction equipment. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes for the tower cranes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the cranes without significant portions being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
