Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. So, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the building and misses the top part of the crane. Therefore, the fit is not accurate.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
