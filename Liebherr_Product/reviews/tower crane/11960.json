It includes parts of the building and other structures, which means it is not precise.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one bounding box, but there are multiple tower cranes in the image. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant amount of the surrounding area, not just the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
