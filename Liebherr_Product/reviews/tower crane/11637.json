In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although the bounding boxes are quite large and include some surrounding areas. However, they do not enclose multiple objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are somewhat loose, especially the purple one, which includes a significant portion of the building and the sky. The red and orange bounding boxes are also slightly loose but not as much as the purple one.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box encloses a single tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are too loose, especially the purple one.",
