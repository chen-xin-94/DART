The purple bounding box is more accurate but still includes some extra space. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the building. The purple bounding box is slightly better but still includes some extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
