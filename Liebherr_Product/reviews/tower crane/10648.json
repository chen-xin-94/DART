The box is well-placed around the crane, even though the crane is partially occluded by other structures. The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crane, considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
