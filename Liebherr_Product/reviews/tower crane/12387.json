However, based on the visible part, it seems to be reasonably accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane visible in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be slightly loose, as it includes some surrounding area, but it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
