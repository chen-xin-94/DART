The crane is partially occluded by other structures, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size and position.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the tower crane, considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
