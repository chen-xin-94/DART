There are no other tower cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the background.\n   - The purple bounding box is also too loose, including a significant portion of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes include too much of the background and are not tightly enclosing the tower cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are too loose and include a lot of the surrounding area.",
