The purple bounding box includes parts of the crane's surroundings, and the red bounding box includes parts of the building and construction site.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are not well-fitted. The purple bounding box is too loose, including a significant amount of the sky and surroundings. The red bounding box is also too loose, including parts of the building and construction site.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
