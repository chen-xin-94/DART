However, the bounding box on the left (red) includes parts of another crane, which affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit well around the tower cranes, though the leftmost bounding box (red) is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the leftmost bounding box includes parts of another crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the leftmost bounding box is slightly loose.",
