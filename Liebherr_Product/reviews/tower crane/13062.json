The box is well-placed around the crane's structure.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.68\" (red) also encloses a single tower crane. The box is well-placed around the crane's structure.\n   - Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The purple bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the tower crane.\n   - The red bounding box is slightly tight but still reasonably fits the tower crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
