The second bounding box (red) encloses another tower crane in the center of the image. Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no other tower cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They accurately enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
