The red bounding box is too tight and cuts off parts of the crane, while the purple bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the background.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes visible, but only two are annotated with bounding boxes. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too tight, cutting off parts of the crane, and the purple bounding box is too loose, including parts of the background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
