In this image, each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the frame. The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated to include the entire crane structure.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are five visible tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and partial visibility. They are neither excessively loose nor overly tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
