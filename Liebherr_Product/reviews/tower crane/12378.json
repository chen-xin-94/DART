The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some background elements. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes more background than necessary. The purple one is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
