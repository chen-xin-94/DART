However, it does not perfectly enclose the entire crane, as parts of the crane are outside the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight, cutting off parts of the crane, especially the top and the left side.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
