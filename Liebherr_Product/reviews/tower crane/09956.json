This could be considered as not perfectly enclosing a single target object. The box on the left (purple) seems to be more precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left (purple) fits well around the tower crane. The bounding box on the right (red) is a bit too loose as it includes a large portion of the crane's arm that extends beyond the main structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
