The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right both enclose single tower cranes. The occlusion of the cranes is minimal, and the bounding boxes are inferred correctly.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for the crane's structure.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
