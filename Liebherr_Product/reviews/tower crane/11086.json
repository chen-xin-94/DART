The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they cover the cranes adequately.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
