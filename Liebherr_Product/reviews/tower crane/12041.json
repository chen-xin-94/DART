The right bounding box (purple) also encloses a single tower crane accurately. Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts of the objects or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
