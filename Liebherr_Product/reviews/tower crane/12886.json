The bounding box on the right (purple) does enclose the tower crane, but it also includes a significant portion of the building, which is not part of the target object. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no missed tower cranes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left (red) is too tight, cutting off parts of the crane. The bounding box on the right (purple) is too loose, including a significant portion of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
