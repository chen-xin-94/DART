There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn. This does not meet the requirement of enclosing each tower crane individually.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the tower crane it encloses. However, since it does not enclose a single tower crane perfectly, this criterion is not fully met.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
