However, it also includes parts of the surrounding environment, such as buildings and other structures. This makes the bounding box not perfectly precise.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of the surrounding environment. It could be tighter to better fit the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
