The red bounding box encloses the larger tower crane on the right, and the purple bounding box encloses the smaller tower crane on the left. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are accounted for.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top and right side, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but still reasonably encloses the smaller tower crane. Both bounding boxes are acceptable in terms of fit.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
