In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the left bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the crane. The right bounding box is more accurate but slightly loose at the top.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box is too tight, and the right bounding box is slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
