It seems to cover the entire structure of the crane, including the base and the arm.\n   - The second bounding box (purple) encloses the tower crane in the middle of the image. It also seems to cover the entire structure of the crane, including the base and the arm.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - The purple bounding box is also slightly loose, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too tight nor too loose to a significant degree.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
