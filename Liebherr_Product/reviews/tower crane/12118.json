The box is too loose and includes parts of the building and other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including significant portions of the surrounding area and not tightly fitting the tower crane.",
