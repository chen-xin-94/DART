This makes the precision not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of the trees and other background elements, but it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
