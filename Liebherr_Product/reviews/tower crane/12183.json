It does not include any other objects.\n   - The bounding box on the right (red) also encloses the entire tower crane, including the horizontal arm and the vertical structure. It does not include any other objects.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box on the left (purple) is slightly loose, especially at the bottom, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane.\n   - The bounding box on the right (red) is also slightly loose, especially at the bottom, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight to a significant degree.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n- **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted, not too loose or too tight.",
