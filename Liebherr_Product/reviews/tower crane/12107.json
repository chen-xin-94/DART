The purple bounding box also encloses one tower crane accurately. Therefore, both bounding boxes meet the precision criteria.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes visible, but only two are annotated. Therefore, the recall is not fully met as not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane, and the purple bounding box also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes meet the fit criteria.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
