The purple bounding box correctly encloses one tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose as it encloses two tower cranes.
