The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some non-crane elements. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes a significant portion of the construction site. The purple bounding box is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
