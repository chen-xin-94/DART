However, the bounding box on the left (red) is too loose and includes parts of the construction site that are not part of the crane. The other two bounding boxes (purple and orange) seem to enclose their respective cranes more accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the construction site. The purple and orange bounding boxes fit their respective cranes well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the red bounding box is too loose and includes non-crane elements.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the red bounding box is too loose.",
