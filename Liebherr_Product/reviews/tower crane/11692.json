In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the box on the right also includes part of the building and trees, which is not ideal. The box on the left is more precise but still includes some extra space around the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left is slightly loose but acceptable. The bounding box on the right is too loose as it includes parts of the building and trees.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
