In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although the bounding box on the right (orange) is slightly loose and includes some extra structures. However, it still primarily focuses on the tower crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, though the rightmost bounding box is slightly loose. However, it is not excessively loose to the point of being incorrect.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
