In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box also includes part of the building under construction. The purple bounding box is more accurate but still includes a bit of the building. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is a bit loose as it includes part of the building. The purple bounding box is slightly better but still includes some of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
