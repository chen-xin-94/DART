However, there are multiple tower cranes in the image that are not enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are at least two other tower cranes visible in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane appears to be neither too loose nor too tight. It reasonably encloses the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
