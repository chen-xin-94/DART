Specifically, there are at least two more tower cranes visible in the background that are not enclosed by any bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The purple bounding box (0.73) is slightly loose but generally fits the tower crane well.\n   - The red bounding box (0.69) is also slightly loose but generally fits the tower crane well.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight, even though they are slightly loose, they still fit the tower cranes well.",
