In this image, the purple bounding box on the left encloses multiple tower cranes, which is incorrect. The red bounding box on the right correctly encloses a single tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two bounding boxes are present.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box on the right fits well around the tower crane. The purple bounding box on the left is too loose and includes multiple cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
