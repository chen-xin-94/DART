In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, but there is some overlap between the bounding boxes. However, this overlap does not affect the precision significantly as each box still primarily focuses on a single crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, although there is some slight overlap and minor areas where the boxes might be a bit loose or tight. However, these minor issues do not significantly affect the overall fit.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
