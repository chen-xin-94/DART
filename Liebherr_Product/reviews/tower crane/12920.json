There is no significant part of the crane outside the bounding box, and it does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. The bounding box does not cover the second crane on the right side of the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the central tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
