The crane is partially occluded by trees, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size.\n   - The purple bounding box on the right also encloses a single tower crane. The crane is fully visible and the bounding box accurately encloses it.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane.\n   - The purple bounding box on the right fits well around the tower crane, neither too tight nor too loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n- **Recall**: All target objects (two tower cranes) are localized by bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted around the tower cranes.",
