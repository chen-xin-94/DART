The bounding box for the object on the left (red box) is incorrect as it encloses a different type of crane (not a tower crane). Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the tower crane on the right (purple box) is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding box for the object on the left (red box) is irrelevant for this evaluation as it does not enclose a tower crane.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
