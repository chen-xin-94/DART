Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: All the tower cranes in the image are localized by the bounding box. Therefore, the recall is met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it encloses multiple tower cranes and a significant amount of background area. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
