There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but the bounding box only encloses one of them. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is reasonably well-fitted to the tower crane it encloses. It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
