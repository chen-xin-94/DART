It includes parts of the construction site and other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the surrounding area and not just the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
