The bounding box should be focused on the tower crane itself, not the entire building.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane visible in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes the entire building rather than just the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
