This means it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n   - The red bounding box encloses a tower crane, but it also includes parts of the crane's base and some surrounding structures. This means it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no tower cranes left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of another crane and some surrounding structures.\n   - The red bounding box is also too loose as it includes parts of the crane's base and some surrounding structures.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose single tower cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding boxes are too loose and include parts of other objects and structures.",
