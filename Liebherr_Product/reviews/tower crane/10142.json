                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. The purple bounding box (0.71) correctly encloses one tower crane. The red bounding box (0.60) also encloses one tower crane, but it includes a bit of the surrounding area. However, it is still reasonable.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by the bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box (0.71) fits well around the tower crane. The red bounding box (0.60) is slightly loose but still acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
