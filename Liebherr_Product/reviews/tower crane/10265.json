In this image, the purple bounding box correctly encloses the tower crane, but the red bounding box does not. The red bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the surrounding area that are not part of the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, but the red bounding box is too loose and includes unnecessary parts of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
