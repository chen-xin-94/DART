The red bounding box also correctly encloses another tower crane. Therefore, both bounding boxes meet the precision criterion.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall criterion is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
