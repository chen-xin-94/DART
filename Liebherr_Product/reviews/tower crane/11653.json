Each bounding box contains one single tower crane, and the occlusion by trees is reasonably accounted for.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, even considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
