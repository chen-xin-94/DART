The box on the right is more precise but still includes some extra space. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are somewhat loose, especially the one on the left, which includes a lot of extra space. The one on the right is better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
