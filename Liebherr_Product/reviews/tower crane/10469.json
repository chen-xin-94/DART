The annotations are accurate and do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
