In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but some of them also include parts of other structures or cranes. This slightly reduces precision.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. The image shows multiple tower cranes, and all of them appear to be annotated with bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, though some might be slightly loose or tight.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
