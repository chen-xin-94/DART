In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes, but the purple bounding box on the left seems to include part of the building structure, which is not part of the tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes, and it appears that all of them are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the tower cranes reasonably well, although the purple bounding box on the left is slightly loose as it includes part of the building structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
