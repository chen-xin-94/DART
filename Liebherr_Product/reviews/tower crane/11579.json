The red bounding box on the left does not fully enclose the tower crane, as it cuts off part of the crane's arm. The purple bounding box on the right does enclose a single tower crane correctly.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too tight as it cuts off part of the crane's arm. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
