Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left (purple) is slightly loose but acceptable. The bounding box on the right (red) is slightly tight but still acceptable.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
