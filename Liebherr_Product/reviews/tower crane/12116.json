Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box on the left (purple) is too loose as it includes multiple cranes and a lot of extra space.\n   - The bounding box on the right (red) fits well around the single tower crane it encloses.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the left bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the left bounding box is too loose and includes multiple cranes.",
