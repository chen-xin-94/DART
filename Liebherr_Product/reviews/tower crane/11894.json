In this image, the red bounding box on the left correctly encloses a single tower crane. The purple bounding box in the middle also correctly encloses a single tower crane. The pink bounding box on the right correctly encloses another single tower crane. Therefore, each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n   \n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left fits well around the tower crane. The purple bounding box in the middle fits well around the tower crane. The pink bounding box on the right also fits well around the tower crane. None of the bounding boxes are too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
