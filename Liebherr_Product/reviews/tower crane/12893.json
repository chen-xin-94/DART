                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane\" do not perfectly enclose the tower cranes. The red bounding box on the left is too loose and includes parts of the building, while the purple bounding box on the right is too tight and cuts off parts of the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all of them are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. As mentioned earlier, the red bounding box is too loose, and the purple bounding box is too tight. Therefore, the fit is not perfect.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
