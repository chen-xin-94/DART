Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is slightly too loose at the top, but it is acceptable. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose on the right side, but it is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
