Both bounding boxes seem to enclose the tower cranes accurately, without including other objects.\n   \n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n   \n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit the tower cranes well, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
