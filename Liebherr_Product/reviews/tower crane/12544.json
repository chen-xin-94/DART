The purple bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right tower crane. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation of the object's size.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes adequately without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
