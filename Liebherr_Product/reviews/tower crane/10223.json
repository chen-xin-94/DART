Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (both tower cranes) are localized by the bounding box, so recall is met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight, but it includes two objects instead of one. However, since the fit is about the tightness or looseness, it is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
