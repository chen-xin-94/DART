Each bounding box contains one tower crane, and the boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, and not all of them are annotated. Only two tower cranes are annotated, while there are more visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, capturing the essential parts without excessive outside area.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
