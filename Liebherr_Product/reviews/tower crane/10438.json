The purple bounding box correctly encloses one tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by the bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose as it encloses two tower cranes. The purple bounding box fits well around the single tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
