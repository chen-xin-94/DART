Therefore, it is not perfectly precise.\n2. **Recall**: There is another tower crane on the right side of the image that is not annotated. Hence, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the bridge and other structures, making it not a perfect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
