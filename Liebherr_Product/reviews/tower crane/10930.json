The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right each contain one tower crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
