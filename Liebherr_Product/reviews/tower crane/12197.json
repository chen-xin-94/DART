However, it also includes part of the building and the crane on the left side. Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of the building and the crane on the left side. It should be more tightly fitted to the tower crane on the right.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
