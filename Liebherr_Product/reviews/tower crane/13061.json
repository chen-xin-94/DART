                "content": "1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose one tower crane each. The red bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both annotations are precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are annotated with bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is complete.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the left tower crane, and the purple bounding box fits well around the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
