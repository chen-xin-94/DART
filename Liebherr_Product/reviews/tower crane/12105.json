Several tower cranes are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.56\" (pink) is too loose as it encloses multiple cranes.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.61\" (purple) fits well.\n   - The bounding box on the right (red) fits well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the pink bounding box encloses multiple cranes.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the pink bounding box is too loose.",
