                "content": "1. **Precision**: The image shows two bounding boxes, each enclosing a tower crane. Both bounding boxes seem to perfectly enclose one single tower crane each. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
