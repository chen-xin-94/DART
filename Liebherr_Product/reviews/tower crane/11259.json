The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly and are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose and do not cut off significant parts of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
