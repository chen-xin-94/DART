In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although some of the bounding boxes overlap with each other. This is acceptable as long as each box is focused on a single crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, although some boxes are slightly loose or tight, they still generally fit the cranes well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
