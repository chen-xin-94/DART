They include parts of the buildings and other structures, which means they are not precisely enclosing only the target objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are more tower cranes in the image that are not annotated. The two bounding boxes do not cover all the tower cranes present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose as they include significant portions of the buildings and other structures, not just the tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
