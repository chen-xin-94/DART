In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single tower crane, although some of the bounding boxes are slightly loose or tight. However, they still reasonably enclose the target objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are generally well-fitted, though some are slightly loose or tight. However, they are within acceptable limits.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
