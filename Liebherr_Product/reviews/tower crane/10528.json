The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.59\" in red also correctly encloses the tower crane in the center of the image. Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.69\" in purple is slightly loose but still acceptable as it encloses the entire crane. The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.59\" in red is slightly tight but still acceptable as it encloses the entire crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
