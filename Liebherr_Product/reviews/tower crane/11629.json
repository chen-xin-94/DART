The purple bounding box on the left is also too tight and cuts off the crane's base. The orange bounding box on the right is too loose and includes a significant amount of background. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are not well-fitted. The red and purple bounding boxes are too tight, and the orange bounding box is too loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
