The box on the right is also slightly loose, including some sky area. However, both boxes do enclose the target objects reasonably well.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose but not excessively so. They are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
