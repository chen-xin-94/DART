However, the bounding boxes are not perfectly aligned with the cranes, especially the ones labeled \"tower crane 0.50\" and \"tower crane 0.51\" which are too loose and include parts of other objects or background.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally too loose, especially the ones labeled \"tower crane 0.50\" and \"tower crane 0.51\". They include significant portions of the background and other objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
