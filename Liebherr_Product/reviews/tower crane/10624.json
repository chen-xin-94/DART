The purple bounding box on the left includes parts of another crane, and the red bounding box on the right is too tight and does not fully enclose the crane.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple tower cranes, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are not well-fitted. The purple bounding box is too loose and includes parts of another crane, while the red bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
