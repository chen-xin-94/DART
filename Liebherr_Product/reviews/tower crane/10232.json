Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object. The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.50\" does enclose a tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.50\" is slightly loose but generally fits the tower crane well enough.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
