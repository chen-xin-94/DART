The one on the right (red) is more accurate but still includes a bit of the structure below the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the purple one, which includes more of the structure below the crane than necessary. However, they are not excessively loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
