In this image, there are multiple bounding boxes, and each one seems to be enclosing a single tower crane. However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.56\" on the left side is enclosing parts of two cranes, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, and all of them appear to be localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, but the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.56\" on the left side is too loose as it includes parts of two cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
