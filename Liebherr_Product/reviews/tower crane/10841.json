The bounding boxes do not include any other objects, so precision is met.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the tower cranes well, with a slight margin around the cranes. This ensures that the entire crane is enclosed without being too tight or too loose.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
