It includes parts of the building and other structures, which means it is not precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple tower cranes, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures. It does not fit the tower crane well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
