However, the red bounding box encloses multiple tower cranes, which is not correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, and they are all covered by the bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane. The red bounding box is a bit loose as it covers multiple cranes, but it does cover the target objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the red bounding box does not enclose a single tower crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes are localized by the bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: No, because the red bounding box is too loose and covers multiple cranes.",
