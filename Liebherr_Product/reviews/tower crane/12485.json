However, it is not perfectly enclosing the entire crane, as parts of the crane are outside the bounding box. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the entire crane. It cuts off parts of the crane, so the fit is not ideal.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
