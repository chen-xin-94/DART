The purple bounding box correctly encloses the smaller tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n   \n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the larger tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the smaller tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
