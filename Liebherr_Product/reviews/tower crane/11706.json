                "content": "1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, there are three bounding boxes, each labeled as \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded or extend beyond the bounding boxes. The bounding boxes reasonably estimate the size of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three visible tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes, even if some parts are slightly cut off or some extra space is included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
