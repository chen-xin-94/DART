This means the bounding box does not accurately represent all the tower cranes present.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be neither too loose nor too tight for the tower crane it encloses. It reasonably fits the annotated tower crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
