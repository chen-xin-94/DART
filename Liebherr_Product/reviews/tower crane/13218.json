Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane appears to be reasonably well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
