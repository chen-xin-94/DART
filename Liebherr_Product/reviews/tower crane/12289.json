Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is another tower crane visible in the image that is not localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area and not just the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
