In this image, the red bounding box encloses the entire tower crane on the right side, and the purple bounding box encloses the tower crane on the left side. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single tower crane each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the entire tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
