The red bounding box on the left seems to enclose both the crane and part of the building, while the purple bounding box on the right seems to enclose only the crane. Therefore, the red bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes, although the red bounding box includes part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
