The red bounding box also encloses one tower crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes nor including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
