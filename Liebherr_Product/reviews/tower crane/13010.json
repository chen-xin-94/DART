It does not include any other objects and is reasonably inferred even though parts of the crane are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: There is another tower crane visible in the background on the left side of the image that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is well-fitted to the main tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
