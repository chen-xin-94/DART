However, the purple bounding box encloses both the tower crane and part of the building, which is not ideal.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both tower cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane. The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
