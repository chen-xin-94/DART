Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: The bounding box does localize all the tower cranes in the image, but it does so in a single bounding box rather than individual ones.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple cranes and other structures, not just a single tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
