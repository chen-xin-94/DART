There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the tower cranes well, with slight allowances for occlusion and reasonable estimation of the crane's size.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
