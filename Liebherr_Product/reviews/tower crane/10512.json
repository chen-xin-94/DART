However, the red bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the building and another crane. The pink bounding box is also too loose and includes parts of the building and another crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane. The red and pink bounding boxes are too loose, including parts of the building and other cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
