Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes significant portions of the surrounding area that are not part of the tower crane. Therefore, the fit is not correct.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
