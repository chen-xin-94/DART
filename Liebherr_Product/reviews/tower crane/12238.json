The purple bounding box encloses the entire tower crane on the left, and the red bounding box encloses the tower crane on the right. Both annotations are precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane on the left, and the red bounding box fits well around the tower crane on the right. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
