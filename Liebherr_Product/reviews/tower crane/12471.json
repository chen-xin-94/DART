The purple bounding box also does not perfectly enclose a single tower crane; it includes parts of the construction site as well. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: Both tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is met.\n3. **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are too loose, including significant portions of the surrounding area. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
