It includes parts of the building and other structures.\n   - The purple bounding box on the right does enclose a single tower crane, but it also includes parts of the building and other structures.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box on the left is too loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures.\n   - The purple bounding box on the right is also too loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
