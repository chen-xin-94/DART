It includes parts of the building and other structures.\n   - The second bounding box (smaller one) also does not perfectly enclose a single tower crane. It includes parts of the building and other structures.\n   \n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the building and other structures.\n   - The second bounding box is also too loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
