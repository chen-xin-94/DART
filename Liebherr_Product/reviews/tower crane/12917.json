In this image, the red bounding box (tower crane 0.58) correctly encloses one tower crane. The purple bounding box (tower crane 0.70) also correctly encloses one tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes. However, only two of them are annotated with bounding boxes. The third tower crane, located in the middle background, is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box (tower crane 0.58) fits well around the tower crane, and the purple bounding box (tower crane 0.70) also fits well around the tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.",
