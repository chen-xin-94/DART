The one on the right (red) is more precise but still includes some extra space at the bottom. However, both boxes do enclose a single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the purple one on the left. They could be tighter to better fit the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
