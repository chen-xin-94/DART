The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some background.\n2. **Recall**: Both tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant amount of background. The purple bounding box is a better fit but still includes some background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
