However, the bounding box for the crane on the right is too loose and includes a lot of extra space. The other two bounding boxes are more precise but still include some extra space.\n2. **Recall**: All three tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are not too tight, but the one on the right is too loose, including a significant amount of extra space.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
