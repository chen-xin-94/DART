The larger bounding box (purple) encloses the entire tower crane on the left, and the smaller bounding box (red) encloses the tower crane on the right. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single tower crane each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose as it includes some extra space around the crane, but it is not excessively loose. The red bounding box fits the tower crane on the right well.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
