In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box also includes part of the building structure. This means it does not perfectly enclose just the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the building structure, while the purple bounding boxes seem to fit well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
