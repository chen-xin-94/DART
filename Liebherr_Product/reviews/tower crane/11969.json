They either include parts of the building or are too loose.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Precision**: The bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose single tower cranes; they include parts of the building.\n- **Recall**: All visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: The bounding boxes are not well-fitted to the tower cranes; they are either too loose or include parts of the building.",
