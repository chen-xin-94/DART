There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of multiple tower cranes and some surrounding structures.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
