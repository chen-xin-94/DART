However, the bounding box on the left (purple) includes part of another crane's arm, which slightly affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit well around the tower cranes, though some are slightly loose, especially the red and pink boxes, which include some extra space around the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the purple bounding box includes part of another crane's arm.\n- **Recall**: Yes, all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, the bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, though some are slightly loose.",
