The red bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both annotations are precise in terms of enclosing a single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose as it includes some extra area around the crane, but it is not excessively loose. The purple bounding box fits the right tower crane well, with only a slight inclusion of the surrounding area. Both bounding boxes are acceptable in terms of fit.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
