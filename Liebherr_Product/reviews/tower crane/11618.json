There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.51\" is a bit loose as it includes parts of another crane and some surrounding structures.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.62\" fits well around the tower crane, neither too tight nor too loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.51\" does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.51\" is too loose and includes parts of another crane and surrounding structures.",
