Instead, they enclose multiple cranes or parts of cranes. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple tower cranes, but only two bounding boxes are present. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is not met.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose, as they enclose multiple cranes or parts of cranes rather than a single crane. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
