However, the red bounding box is slightly off as it includes part of the other crane's arm. The purple bounding box is more accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the other crane's arm. The purple bounding box fits well around the crane it is annotating.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
