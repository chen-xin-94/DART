However, the bounding box on the left (red) includes part of the building, which slightly reduces precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the red bounding box on the left is slightly loose as it includes part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
