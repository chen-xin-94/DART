The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even though parts of the cranes are occluded by buildings.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
