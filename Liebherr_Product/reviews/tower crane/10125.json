In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes, but the leftmost bounding box (purple) includes parts of another crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the cranes reasonably well, though the leftmost bounding box (purple) is slightly loose as it includes parts of another crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
