In this image, each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, even if some cranes are partially occluded. The bounding boxes are reasonably estimated to cover the entire crane structure.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are annotated with bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs, which are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
