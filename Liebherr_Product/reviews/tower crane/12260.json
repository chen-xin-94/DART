In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the orange bounding box on the right side seems to include parts of the building and other structures, which is not ideal. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, but the orange bounding box on the right side is too loose as it includes parts of the building and other structures.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
