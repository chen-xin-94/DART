In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box is too tight and cuts off parts of the crane. The purple bounding box is too loose and includes a lot of unnecessary background.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too tight, and the purple bounding box is too loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
