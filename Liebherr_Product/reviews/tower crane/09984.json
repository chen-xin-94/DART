However, it does not perfectly enclose the entire crane, as the top part of the crane is cut off. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly too tight, cutting off the top part of the crane. It should ideally enclose the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
