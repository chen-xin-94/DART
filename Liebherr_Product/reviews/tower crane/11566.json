The red bounding box encloses parts of two tower cranes, and the purple bounding box also encloses parts of two tower cranes. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are within the bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are somewhat loose as they include parts of other objects and do not tightly fit around the individual tower cranes. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
