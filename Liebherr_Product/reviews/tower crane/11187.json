Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes are within the bounding box, so recall is high.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes more than just the tower cranes, covering parts of the construction site and other objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
