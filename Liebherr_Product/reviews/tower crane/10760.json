However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.60\" also includes part of a black crane, which is not a tower crane. This reduces the precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit well around the tower cranes, though some are slightly loose, especially the one labeled \"tower crane 0.61\" on the right side of the image.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.60\" includes part of a non-target object.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding boxes generally fit well around the tower cranes, even if some are slightly loose.",
