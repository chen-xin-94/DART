The bounding boxes are drawn around the cranes, and even though some parts of the cranes are occluded, the bounding boxes reasonably estimate the size of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably cover the cranes without significant parts being outside the boxes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
