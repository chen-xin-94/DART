The crane is well-defined within the box, even though part of it is occluded by the horizontal structure in the foreground.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately covers the entire crane, including the extended arm, without significant portions being cut off or excessive empty space around it.",
