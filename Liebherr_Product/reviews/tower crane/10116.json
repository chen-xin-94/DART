However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.62\" (orange) includes parts of another crane's jib, which affects precision.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.52\" (yellow) also includes parts of another crane's jib.\n   - The other bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, though some are slightly loose, especially the orange and yellow ones, which include parts of other cranes.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Precision**: \"No\" because some bounding boxes include parts of other cranes.\n- **Recall**: \"Yes\" because all visible tower cranes are localized.\n- **Fit**: \"No\" because some bounding boxes are slightly loose and include parts of other cranes.",
