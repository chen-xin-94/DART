The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some extra space around the crane.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the construction site and trees. The purple bounding box is slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
