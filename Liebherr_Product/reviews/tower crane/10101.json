For example, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.53\" encloses multiple cranes, and the box labeled \"tower crane 0.66\" also overlaps with another crane.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All target objects should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - All visible tower cranes in the image are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted to the cranes, but some are slightly loose or tight. For example, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.66\" is slightly loose, and the box labeled \"tower crane 0.60\" is slightly tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because some bounding boxes overlap multiple cranes or parts of cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: No, because some bounding boxes are slightly loose or tight.",
