The red bounding box encloses multiple tower cranes, and the purple bounding box also includes parts of other cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image that are not enclosed by any bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose. They enclose multiple cranes and a significant amount of background area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
