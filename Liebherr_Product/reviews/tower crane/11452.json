Both bounding boxes correctly identify individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but still reasonably fits the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
