In the image, each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image should be localized by a bounding box. There are four tower cranes in the image, and all of them are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
