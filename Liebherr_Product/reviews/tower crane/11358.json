Each bounding box contains one single tower crane, and the occluded parts are reasonably inferred.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the tower cranes, with only slight cutting off or enclosing a bit of the outside area, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
