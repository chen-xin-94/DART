The annotations are clear and do not include multiple objects within a single bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the tower cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably estimate the size of the cranes, even if parts are occluded.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
