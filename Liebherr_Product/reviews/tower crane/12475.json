The purple bounding box also correctly encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n   \n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the first tower crane, and the purple bounding box fits well around the second tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
