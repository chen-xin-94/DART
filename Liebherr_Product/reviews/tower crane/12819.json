The purple bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left tower crane is well-fitted, covering the entire structure without being too loose or too tight. The red bounding box on the right tower crane is also well-fitted, covering the entire structure appropriately.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
