Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are several other tower cranes visible in the background that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated tower crane appears to be neither too loose nor too tight. It reasonably encloses the tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
