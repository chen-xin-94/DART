It is not perfectly enclosing just the tower crane.\n   - The red bounding box also encloses a single tower crane, but it includes parts of the bridge and other structures as well. It is not perfectly enclosing just the tower crane.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the bridge and other structures.\n   - The red bounding box is also too loose as it includes parts of the bridge and other structures.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
