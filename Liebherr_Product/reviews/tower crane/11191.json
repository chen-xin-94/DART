However, it does not perfectly enclose the entire crane, as parts of the crane are outside the bounding box. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the part of the crane it encloses, but it does not cover the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
