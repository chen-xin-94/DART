In the image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box seems to enclose a single tower crane without including other objects. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
