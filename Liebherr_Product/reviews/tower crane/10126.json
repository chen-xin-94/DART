In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box on the left includes two tower cranes, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are four tower cranes in the image, and all of them are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit well around the tower cranes, though the red bounding box on the left is too loose as it includes two cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
