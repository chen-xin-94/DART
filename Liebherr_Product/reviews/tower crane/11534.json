In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose individual tower cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted around the tower cranes, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
