Not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple tower cranes and a lot of extra space.\n   - The purple bounding box fits well around the single tower crane it encloses.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: No, because the red bounding box does not enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the red bounding box is too loose.",
