In this image, the red bounding box (tower crane 0.52) and the purple bounding box (tower crane 0.54) both enclose parts of multiple tower cranes. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the tower cranes, although they include parts of other cranes as well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
