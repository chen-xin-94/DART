The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and are focused on the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they cover the cranes adequately.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
