There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn around both of them. This does not meet the requirement of enclosing one single target object per bounding box.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn, which means one of the tower cranes is not individually localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the two tower cranes it encloses. However, since it should enclose only one tower crane, this criterion is not fully met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
