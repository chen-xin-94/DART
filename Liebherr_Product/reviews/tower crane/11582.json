Therefore, it is impossible to determine if each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Since there are no bounding boxes present, it is clear that not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Without any bounding boxes, we cannot assess whether the fit is appropriate.\n\nGiven these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
