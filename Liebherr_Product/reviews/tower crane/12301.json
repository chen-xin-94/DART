It appears to cover the entire crane structure, including the jib and the tower.\n   - The second bounding box (purple) encloses another tower crane on the right side of the image. It also appears to cover the entire crane structure.\n   - Both bounding boxes seem to perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes visible in the image, and both are localized by a bounding box.\n   - No tower cranes are missed.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The red bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - The purple bounding box is also slightly loose, but it is not excessively loose.\n   - Both bounding boxes are neither too tight nor too loose to a significant degree.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n- **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.",
