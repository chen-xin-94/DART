Each bounding box contains one single tower crane, and the occluded parts are reasonably estimated.\n2. **Recall**: There are more than two tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit the tower cranes well, with only slight cutting off or enclosing a little bit of the outside area, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
