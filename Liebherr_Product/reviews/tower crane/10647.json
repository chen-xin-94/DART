The red bounding box is more precise but still includes some extra space. However, both boxes reasonably enclose the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose but not excessively so. They reasonably fit the cranes without cutting off significant parts of the objects.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
