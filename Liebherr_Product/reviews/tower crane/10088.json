However, the purple bounding box on the right encloses two tower cranes, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left fits well around the tower crane. The purple bounding box on the right is too loose as it includes two tower cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the purple bounding box encloses two tower cranes instead of one.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the purple bounding box is too loose and includes two tower cranes.",
