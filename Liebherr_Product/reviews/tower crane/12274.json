                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the purple bounding box encloses one tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes correctly identify individual tower cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane. The red bounding box is also slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
