However, the purple bounding box also includes parts of other cranes in the background, which slightly affects precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane. The purple bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of other cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the purple bounding box includes parts of other cranes.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all tower cranes are annotated.\n- **Fit**: No, because the purple bounding box is slightly loose.",
