In the image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single tower crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the frame. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are four tower cranes, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and partial visibility. The boxes are not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
