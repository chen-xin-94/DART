The left bounding box (purple) correctly encloses the entire tower crane, while the right bounding box (red) also correctly encloses the tower crane. Both bounding boxes are accurate in terms of precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) fits well around the tower crane, and the right bounding box (red) also fits well around the tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
