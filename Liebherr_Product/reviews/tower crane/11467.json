However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.52\" includes part of the building and the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.61\" includes part of the building as well. This affects the precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three tower cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.52\" and \"tower crane 0.61\" are slightly loose as they include parts of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
