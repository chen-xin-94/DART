In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the middle bounding box (purple) seems to be slightly off, as it includes part of the building and does not fully enclose the crane. The other two bounding boxes (red and orange) seem to be correctly enclosing the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The middle bounding box (purple) is slightly loose as it includes part of the building. The other two bounding boxes (red and orange) fit well.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
