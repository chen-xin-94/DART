The red bounding box encloses a smaller tower crane, and the purple bounding box encloses a larger tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the smaller tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the larger tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
