There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.70\" (purple) is well-fitted to the larger tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.58\" (red) is also well-fitted to the smaller tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
