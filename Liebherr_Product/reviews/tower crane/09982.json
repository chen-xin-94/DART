The boxes are well-placed around the cranes, even though parts of the cranes are occluded by other objects in the image. The bounding boxes are inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional tower cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes appropriately, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
