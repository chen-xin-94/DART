In this image, the red bounding box encloses the horizontal part of a tower crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the vertical part of another tower crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the horizontal part of the tower crane. The purple bounding box fits the vertical part of the tower crane well.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
