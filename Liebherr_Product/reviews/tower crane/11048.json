The bounding box on the right (purple) correctly encloses a tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one is correctly localized by a bounding box (the purple one). The red bounding box is incorrectly placed.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box does not fit a tower crane at all.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
