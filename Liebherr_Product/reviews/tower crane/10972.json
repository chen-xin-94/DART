The purple bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the left tower crane, and the red bounding box fits well around the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes nor including too much extra space.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
