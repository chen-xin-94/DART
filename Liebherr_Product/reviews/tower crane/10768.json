The annotations are reasonably accurate, even though the cranes are partially occluded by trees and buildings. The bounding boxes are inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes, and each one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, considering the occlusions and the overall size of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
