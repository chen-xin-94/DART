There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including parts of the building and other structures, which means it does not fit the target object well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
