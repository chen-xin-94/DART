However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.57\" and \"tower crane 0.72\" are overlapping, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing individual cranes. The other bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose individual cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the cranes reasonably well, although the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.77\" is slightly loose, it still reasonably encloses the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane 0.57\" and \"tower crane 0.72\" are overlapping, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing individual cranes.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding boxes reasonably fit the cranes, even though one is slightly loose.",
