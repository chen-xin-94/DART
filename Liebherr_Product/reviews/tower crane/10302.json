In this image, the red bounding box (0.59) and the purple bounding box (0.70) each enclose a single tower crane. The red bounding box does not overlap with the purple bounding box, and each box contains only one tower crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box (0.59) fits well around the tower crane, and the purple bounding box (0.70) also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes are reasonably tight without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
