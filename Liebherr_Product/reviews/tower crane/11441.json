There are three tower cranes, and all three are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple tower cranes and a lot of surrounding area.\n   - The second and third bounding boxes fit well around their respective tower cranes, neither too tight nor too loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because the first bounding box does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n- **Recall** is \"Yes\" because all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"No\" because the first bounding box is too loose and includes multiple objects.",
