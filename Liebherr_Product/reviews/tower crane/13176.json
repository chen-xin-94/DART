In this image, the purple bounding box encloses the left tower crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single tower crane each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the left tower crane, and the red bounding box fits well around the right tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
