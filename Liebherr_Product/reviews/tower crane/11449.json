In the image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box seems to enclose a single tower crane, although the orange bounding box on the left includes some trees, which might be considered as not perfectly enclosing the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, but the orange bounding box on the left includes some trees, making it a bit loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the orange bounding box on the left includes some trees.\n- **Recall**: Yes, all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, the orange bounding box on the left is a bit loose as it includes some trees.\n\nHere is the JSON evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
