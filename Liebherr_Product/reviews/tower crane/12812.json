Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes are localized by the bounding box, so recall is satisfactory.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple cranes and a significant amount of surrounding area that is not part of any tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
