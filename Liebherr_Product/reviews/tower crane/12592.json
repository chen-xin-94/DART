In the image, the bounding boxes do seem to enclose individual tower cranes, but there is some overlap between the bounding boxes, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing single objects. However, given the occlusion and the nature of the objects, this overlap might be acceptable.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three visible tower cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes, with slight overlaps and minor cut-offs that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
