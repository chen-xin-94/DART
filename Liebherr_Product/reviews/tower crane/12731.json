The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits the tower crane, considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
