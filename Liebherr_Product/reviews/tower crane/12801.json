It includes parts of other cranes and does not fully capture the entire structure of the target crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (tower cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes parts of other cranes and does not tightly fit the target crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
