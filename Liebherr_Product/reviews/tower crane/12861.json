The bounding boxes are too loose and include parts of the building and other structures. Therefore, the precision is not satisfactory.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes, and it appears that all of them are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is satisfactory.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. In this image, the bounding boxes are too loose and include parts of the building and other structures. Therefore, the fit is not satisfactory.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
