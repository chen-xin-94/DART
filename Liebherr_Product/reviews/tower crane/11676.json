However, some bounding boxes are overlapping, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing a single tower crane. For example, the orange and yellow bounding boxes overlap significantly, which suggests that they might not be perfectly enclosing individual tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: \n   - All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - The image shows multiple tower cranes, and each one appears to be enclosed by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: \n   - Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes seem to fit the tower cranes reasonably well. They are not excessively loose or tight, although some minor adjustments could improve the fit.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision** is \"No\" because some bounding boxes overlap, indicating that they might not perfectly enclose individual tower cranes.\n- **Recall** is \"Yes\" because all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit** is \"Yes\" because the bounding boxes generally fit the tower cranes well, without being too loose or too tight.",
