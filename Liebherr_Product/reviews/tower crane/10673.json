Even though some cranes are partially occluded, the bounding boxes are reasonably estimated to include the entire crane structure.\n   \n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed within bounding boxes. There are no cranes left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably cover the cranes without significant portions being cut off or excessive background being included.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
