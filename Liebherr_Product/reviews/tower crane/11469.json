Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes part of the building. However, they are not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
