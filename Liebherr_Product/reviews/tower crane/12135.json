The purple bounding box also encloses a single tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all tower cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the tower crane, and the purple bounding box also fits well around the other tower crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
