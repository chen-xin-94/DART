In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the red bounding box also includes parts of another crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple tower cranes, and not all of them are annotated. Therefore, the recall is not perfect.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image seem to fit the cranes reasonably well, though the red bounding box is slightly loose.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
