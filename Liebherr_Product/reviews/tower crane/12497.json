In the image, the bounding boxes do enclose the tower cranes, but the middle bounding box (purple) seems to include parts of another crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, all visible tower cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes seem to fit the cranes reasonably well, though the middle bounding box (purple) is a bit loose and includes parts of another crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
