Therefore, it does not meet the precision criteria.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and only covers a small portion of the crane, missing most of its structure. It does not fit the entire crane properly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
