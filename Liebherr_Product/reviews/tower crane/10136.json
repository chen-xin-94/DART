The crane is partially occluded by the building, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size.\n   - The right bounding box (purple) also encloses a single tower crane. The crane is fully visible and the bounding box accurately encloses it.\n   - Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The left bounding box (red) is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane without including too much of the surrounding area.\n   - The right bounding box (purple) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
