There are no additional tower cranes that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box (purple) fits well around the tower crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The second bounding box (red) also fits well around the tower crane, although it includes a bit of the surrounding area, it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
