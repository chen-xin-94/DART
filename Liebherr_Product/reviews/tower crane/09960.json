The smaller bounding box (red) encloses a distant tower crane, but it also includes some background elements. However, given the distance and size, this is acceptable.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The larger bounding box (purple) fits well around the main tower crane. The smaller bounding box (red) is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the distant tower crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
