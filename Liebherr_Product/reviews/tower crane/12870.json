Instead, it encompasses multiple objects, including the construction site and other elements. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a large area beyond the tower cranes, encompassing parts of the construction site and other elements.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
