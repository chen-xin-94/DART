The bounding boxes are well-placed around the cranes, even though parts of the cranes are occluded by the structures they are working on. The occlusion is minimal and does not affect the precision significantly.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the tower cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off significant parts of the cranes or include too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
