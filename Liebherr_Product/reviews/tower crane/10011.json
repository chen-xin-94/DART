In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"tower crane.\" Each bounding box does indeed enclose a single tower crane, although the bounding boxes overlap slightly. This overlap does not affect the precision as each box still encloses a single tower crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they enclose the cranes adequately.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
