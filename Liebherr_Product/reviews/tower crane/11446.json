                "content": "Let's evaluate the bounding boxes based on the given criteria:\n\n1. **Precision**: Each bounding box should perfectly enclose one single target object (tower crane). \n   - The bounding boxes seem to enclose the tower cranes accurately, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded by buildings. The bounding boxes are inferred based on a reasonable estimation of the cranes' sizes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box.\n   - All visible tower cranes in the image are enclosed by bounding boxes. There are no cranes left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding boxes fit well around the tower cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
