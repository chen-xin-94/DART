The purple bounding box is more accurate but still includes some extra space around the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes part of the building. The purple one is better but still has some extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
