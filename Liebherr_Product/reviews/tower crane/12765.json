In the image, the bounding boxes do seem to enclose individual tower cranes, but there are some issues. The bounding box on the leftmost crane is too tight and does not cover the entire crane. The other bounding boxes seem to be correctly enclosing individual cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, and it appears that all of them are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The leftmost bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire crane. The other bounding boxes seem to fit well, not being too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: No, because the leftmost bounding box does not perfectly enclose the entire crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: No, because the leftmost bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire crane.",
