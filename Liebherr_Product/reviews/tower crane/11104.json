Therefore, it does not meet the precision criterion.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane visible in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Thus, the recall criterion is met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire tower crane. It only captures a small portion of the crane, which means it does not fit well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
