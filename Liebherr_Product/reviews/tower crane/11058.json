The red bounding box on the right is too loose and includes parts of the background. The purple bounding box on the left is too tight and cuts off parts of the crane. The middle red bounding box is also too tight and cuts off parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are more tower cranes in the background that are not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. As mentioned, the bounding boxes are either too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
