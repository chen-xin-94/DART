It includes parts of the building and other objects, which means it does not precisely isolate the tower crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one more tower crane visible in the image that is not localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including significant portions of the surrounding area and not tightly fitting the tower crane.",
