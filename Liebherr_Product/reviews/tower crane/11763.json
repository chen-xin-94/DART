In this image, the red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right each enclose a single tower crane. Both bounding boxes seem to be correctly placed around the tower cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, but only two are annotated with bounding boxes. The middle tower crane is not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right appear to fit well around the tower cranes, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: Yes, each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n- **Recall**: No, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box (the middle tower crane is missing).\n- **Fit**: Yes, each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.",
