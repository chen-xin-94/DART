There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately enclose the tower cranes without cutting off significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
