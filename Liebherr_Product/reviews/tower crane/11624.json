However, the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.63\" also includes part of a building, which slightly reduces precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three tower cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.63\" is slightly loose as it includes part of a building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
