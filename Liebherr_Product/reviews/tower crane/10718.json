Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the respective tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (tower cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit well around the tower cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off significant parts of the cranes or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
