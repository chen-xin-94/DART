In this image, the purple bounding box correctly encloses the tower crane on the left. The red bounding box also correctly encloses the tower crane on the right. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single tower cranes.\n   \n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the tower crane on the left, and the red bounding box fits well around the tower crane on the right. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
