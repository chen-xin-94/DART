The purple bounding box also correctly encloses another tower crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is slightly loose, but it still reasonably encloses the tower crane. The purple bounding box is also slightly loose but acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
