                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. The left bounding box (purple) correctly encloses a single tower crane. The right bounding box (red) also correctly encloses a single tower crane. Both bounding boxes are precise in identifying individual tower cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) fits well around the tower crane, though it slightly cuts off the top part of the crane. The right bounding box (red) also fits well around the tower crane, though it includes a bit of the surrounding area. Both bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
