The crane is partially occluded by trees, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size and position.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one tower crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially on the right side where it extends beyond the crane. However, it is not excessively loose and still reasonably fits the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
