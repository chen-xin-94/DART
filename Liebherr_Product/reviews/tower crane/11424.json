The smaller red bounding box also correctly encloses the tower crane on the right. Both bounding boxes are accurate in terms of precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box slightly cuts off the top of the tower crane, but this is acceptable. The red bounding box fits well around the smaller tower crane.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
