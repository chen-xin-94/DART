In this image, the purple bounding box labeled \"tower\" and the red bounding box labeled \"tower crane 0.52\" both enclose the same two tower cranes. This means that neither bounding box perfectly encloses a single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both tower cranes are enclosed by the bounding boxes, so recall is satisfied.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are reasonably tight around the tower cranes, but since they enclose both cranes together, they do not fit the criteria of enclosing a single target object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
