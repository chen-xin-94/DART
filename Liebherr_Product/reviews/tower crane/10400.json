There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn around all of them. This does not meet the requirement of having each bounding box enclose one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it encompasses multiple tower cranes and a significant portion of the building and surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
