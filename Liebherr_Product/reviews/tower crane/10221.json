In the image, there are two bounding boxes, each enclosing a tower crane. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify and enclose the tower cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two tower cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the tower cranes well. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
