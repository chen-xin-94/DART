There are no additional tower cranes that are missed.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The purple bounding box fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The red bounding box also fits the tower crane well, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
