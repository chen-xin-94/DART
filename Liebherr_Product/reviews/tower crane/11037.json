The first bounding box (purple) encloses the entire structure of the tower crane, and the second bounding box (red) also encloses the entire structure of the tower crane. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are more tower cranes in the image that are not annotated. Specifically, there are at least two more visible tower cranes in the background that are not enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted to the tower cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably enclose the entire structure of the tower cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
