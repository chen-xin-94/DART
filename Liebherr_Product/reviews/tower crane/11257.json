Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: All visible tower cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the box labeled \"tower crane 0.54\" is too loose as it includes part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
