There are multiple tower cranes visible in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn around a group of them. This does not meet the requirement of enclosing one single target object per bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are several tower cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it encloses multiple tower cranes and a significant amount of surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
