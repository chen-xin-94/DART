In this image, the bounding boxes are drawn around the buildings, not the tower cranes. Therefore, the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the target objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two tower cranes in the image, and both should be localized by a bounding box. Since the bounding boxes are not correctly drawn around the tower cranes, the recall is not satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose as they enclose the buildings instead of the tower cranes. Therefore, the fit is not appropriate.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
