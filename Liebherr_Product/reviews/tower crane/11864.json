Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: The bounding box does localize multiple target objects, but it does not localize each one individually. Therefore, the recall is not met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes multiple tower cranes and a significant amount of surrounding area. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
