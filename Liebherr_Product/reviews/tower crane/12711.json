In this image, the bounding box on the left (purple) correctly encloses the tower crane, but the bounding box on the right (red) includes part of the building and does not perfectly enclose the tower crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two tower cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is perfect.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left (purple) fits well, but the bounding box on the right (red) is too loose as it includes part of the building.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
