The bounding boxes are drawn around the cranes, even though some parts of the cranes are occluded by the building or other structures. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three visible tower cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are well-fitted to the cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes, even considering the occlusions.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
