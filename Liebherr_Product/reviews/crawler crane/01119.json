The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box captures the main structure of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, capturing some extra space around the crane, but it is not excessively loose. It does not cut off any significant part of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
