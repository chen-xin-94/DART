                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box on the right each enclose one crawler crane. However, the red bounding box also includes part of the purple bounding box, which is not ideal. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, both crawler cranes are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left fits well around the left crawler crane. The red bounding box on the right is slightly loose as it includes part of the left crawler crane, but it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
