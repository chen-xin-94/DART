In this image, the purple bounding box seems to enclose the left crawler crane accurately, and the red bounding box encloses the right crawler crane. Both bounding boxes seem to be correctly identifying individual crawler cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left crane is slightly loose but acceptable, and the red bounding box on the right crane is also slightly loose but acceptable. Both bounding boxes fit reasonably well.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
