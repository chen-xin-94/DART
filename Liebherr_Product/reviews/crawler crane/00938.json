It seems to be enclosing a part of a different structure or machinery.\n2. **Recall**: Not all crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There is a large crawler crane in the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose and does not fit the target object properly. It includes parts of the background and other objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
