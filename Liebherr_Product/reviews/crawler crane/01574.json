The crane is not occluded, so the bounding box accurately represents its size.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crawler crane well, with minimal outside area included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
