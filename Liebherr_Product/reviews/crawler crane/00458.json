Both boxes seem to cover the cranes without including significant portions of other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes possibly being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
