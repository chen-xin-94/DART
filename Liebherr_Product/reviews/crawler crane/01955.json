In this image, the red bounding box encloses the entire crawler crane, but it also includes part of the wind turbine, which is not part of the target object. The purple bounding box correctly encloses a smaller crawler crane without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose as it includes part of the wind turbine. The purple bounding box fits well around the smaller crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
