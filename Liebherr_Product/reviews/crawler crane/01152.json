In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the crawler cranes, but the red bounding box is too loose and includes parts of other objects. The purple bounding box is more precise but still includes some extra space.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple crawler cranes, but only two are annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose, while the purple bounding box is slightly better but still not perfect.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
