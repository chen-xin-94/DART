The box is well-placed around the crane, even though parts of the crane are occluded by other elements.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler crane, considering the occlusion and the overall size of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
