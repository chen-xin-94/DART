The boxes are well-placed and include the entire structure of the cranes, even though parts of the cranes are occluded by other objects. The bounding boxes are inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes appropriately without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
