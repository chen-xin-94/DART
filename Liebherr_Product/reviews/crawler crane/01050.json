In this image, the bounding box does enclose a single crawler crane, but it also includes some parts of the surrounding environment. However, it is not overly loose or tight, and the crane is the main object within the box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, including some parts of the surrounding environment, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably fits the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
