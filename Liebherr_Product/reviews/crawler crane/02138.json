This could be improved for better precision.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top and sides. It could be tighter to better fit the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
