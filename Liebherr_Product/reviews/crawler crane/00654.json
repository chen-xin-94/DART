The purple bounding box accurately encloses the larger crawler crane, and the red bounding box accurately encloses the smaller crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the larger crawler crane, and the red bounding box fits well around the smaller crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
