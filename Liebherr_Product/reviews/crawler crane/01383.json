It seems to be focused on a smaller part of the crane or another object in the background, rather than the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one crawler crane in the image that is not localized by a bounding box. The large yellow crane in the background is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose and does not fit the target object properly. It includes a lot of surrounding area and does not accurately enclose the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
