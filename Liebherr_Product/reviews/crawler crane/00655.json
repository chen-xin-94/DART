                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single crawler crane. However, the bounding box on the left (purple) seems to be slightly too loose, including some extra space around the crane. The two red bounding boxes on the right also enclose individual crawler cranes accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible crawler cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left is slightly too loose, while the red bounding boxes on the right fit the cranes well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box encloses a single crawler crane.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all visible crawler cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, with only minor issues that are acceptable.",
