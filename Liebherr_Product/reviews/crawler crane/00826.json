In this image, there are two bounding boxes, and both seem to enclose the crawler cranes accurately. The bounding boxes do not include other objects and are reasonably inferred for occluded parts.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes, and both are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the crawler cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and reasonable estimation of the object's size.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
