The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box seems to cover the entire crane without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple crawler cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits the crawler crane well. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
