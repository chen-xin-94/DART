The purple bounding box encloses the larger crane, and the red bounding box encloses the smaller crane. Both boxes appear to cover the entirety of their respective cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the cranes, with slight allowances for the edges, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
