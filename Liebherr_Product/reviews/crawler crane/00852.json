It is too small and only covers a small part of the crane's structure.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple crawler cranes in the image, and only a small part of one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fit the crawler crane properly. It only covers a small portion of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
