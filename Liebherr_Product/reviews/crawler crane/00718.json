                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the bounding boxes do not perfectly enclose the crawler cranes. The bounding boxes are either too loose or include parts of other objects (e.g., wind turbines). Therefore, the precision is not satisfactory.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are multiple crawler cranes, and they all seem to be localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is satisfactory.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. In this image, the bounding boxes are not fitting well. Some bounding boxes are too loose, including parts of other objects, and some are too tight, cutting off parts of the crawler cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
