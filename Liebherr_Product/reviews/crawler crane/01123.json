The bounding box on the right does enclose a single crawler crane.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left is too loose, including a lot of unnecessary background. The bounding box on the right is well-fitted to the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
