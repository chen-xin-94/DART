It includes parts of other objects and misses parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all crawler cranes are localized by a bounding box. There is at least one more crane in the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including unnecessary parts of the image and missing parts of the crane.",
