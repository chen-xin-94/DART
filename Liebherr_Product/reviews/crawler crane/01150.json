It includes multiple cranes and parts of the construction site.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (crawler cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of extra space and other objects besides the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
