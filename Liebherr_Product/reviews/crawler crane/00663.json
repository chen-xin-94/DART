The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three crawler cranes, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the crawler cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and reasonable estimation of the object's size.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
