The crane's boom is partially outside the bounding box, and the box also includes some non-crane elements.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is another crawler crane in the background that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the surrounding area and does not fully enclose the crane's boom.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
