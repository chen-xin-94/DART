It only covers a small portion of the crane's structure, missing significant parts of it.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose and does not fit the crawler crane well. It misses large parts of the crane and includes unnecessary background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
