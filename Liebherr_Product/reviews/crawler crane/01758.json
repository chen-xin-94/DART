The cranes are well-defined within the boxes, and the annotations do not include other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They encompass the entirety of each crane, including the extended arms, without cutting off significant parts or including excessive background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
