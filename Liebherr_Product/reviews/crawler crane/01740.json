In this image, the purple bounding box encloses one crawler crane, and the red bounding box encloses another crawler crane. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the crawler crane, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
