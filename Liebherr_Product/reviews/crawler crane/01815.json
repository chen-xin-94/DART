The bounding box on the right also encloses the crawler crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both crawler cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They accurately enclose the crawler cranes, including their extended arms.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
