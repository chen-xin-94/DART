There is no significant part of the crane outside the bounding box, and it does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is well-fitted to the crawler crane. It is neither too loose nor too tight, as it includes the entire structure of the crane without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
