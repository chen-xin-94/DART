In this image, the purple bounding box on the left and the red bounding box on the right each enclose a single crawler crane. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly identify and enclose the respective crawler cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit the crawler cranes well, with a slight allowance for the crane's structure and possible occlusions.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
