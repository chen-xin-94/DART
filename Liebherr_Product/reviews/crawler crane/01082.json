In this image, the bounding boxes labeled \"crawler crane\" do not perfectly enclose the crawler cranes. The bounding box on the left includes part of the wind turbine, and the bounding box on the right is too loose, including a lot of empty space around the crane. The middle bounding box is also too loose and includes parts of the wind turbine.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible crawler cranes are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are too loose, including unnecessary parts of the wind turbines and empty space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
