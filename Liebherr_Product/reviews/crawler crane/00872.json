The bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are annotated with bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the crawler cranes, with a reasonable estimation of the crane's size, even if parts are occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
