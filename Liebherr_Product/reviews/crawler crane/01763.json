In this image, the red bounding box encloses the crawler crane on the left, and the purple bounding box encloses the crawler crane on the right. Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the respective crawler cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane. The purple bounding box on the right is a good fit, as it closely follows the crane's structure without being too tight or too loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
