The left bounding box (purple) is more accurate but still slightly cuts off the base. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly too tight, especially the red one on the right, which cuts off part of the crane's base.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
