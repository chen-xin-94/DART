It only covers a part of the crane's arm, missing the main body and other parts of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is at least one more crawler crane in the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant amount of background space and does not cover the entire crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
