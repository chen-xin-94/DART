The purple bounding box encloses the left crawler crane, and the red bounding box encloses the right crawler crane. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded or extend beyond the image frame.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They adequately cover the crawler cranes without significant portions being outside the boxes or excessive empty space within the boxes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
