The red bounding box also encloses one crawler crane accurately. Therefore, both bounding boxes meet the precision criterion.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall criterion is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits the crawler crane well, covering the entire structure without being too loose or too tight. The red bounding box also fits the crawler crane well, covering the entire structure without being too loose or too tight. Therefore, the fit criterion is met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
