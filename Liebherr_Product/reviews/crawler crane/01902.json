The first bounding box (purple) correctly encloses the crawler crane, but the second bounding box (red) does not enclose a crawler crane; it encloses a different type of crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The first bounding box (purple) fits well around the crawler crane. The second bounding box (red) is irrelevant as it does not enclose a crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
