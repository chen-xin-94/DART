The red bounding box encloses the yellow crawler crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the blue crawler crane. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they adequately cover the entire structure of each crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
