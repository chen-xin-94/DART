The red bounding box encloses the left crawler crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left crane is slightly loose at the bottom, but it still reasonably encloses the crane. The purple bounding box on the right crane is well-fitted, enclosing the crane without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
