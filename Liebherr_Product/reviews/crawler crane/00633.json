The bounding box in the image appears to enclose a single crawler crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There is only one crawler crane visible in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box seems to fit the crawler crane well, without cutting off significant parts of the object or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
