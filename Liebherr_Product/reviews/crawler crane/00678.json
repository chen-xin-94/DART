Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual crawler cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it is acceptable. The purple bounding box fits well around the smaller crawler crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
