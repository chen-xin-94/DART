Instead, it encloses a smaller crane on the right side of the image. The main crawler crane, which is the larger yellow and red crane in the center, is not enclosed by any bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (crawler cranes) are localized by a bounding box. The main crawler crane in the center of the image is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the smaller crane on the right side of the image is reasonably well-fitted, but it is not the main target object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
