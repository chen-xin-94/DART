The bounding boxes are drawn around the cranes, including their booms and bases, which is appropriate.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the cranes, including their booms and bases, without significant parts being cut off or excessive empty space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
