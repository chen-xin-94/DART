The right bounding box (purple) also correctly encloses another crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual crawler cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (red) fits well around the crawler crane, although it slightly cuts off the top part of the crane's boom, it is acceptable. The right bounding box (purple) also fits well around the crawler crane, with a slight cut-off at the top, but it is within acceptable limits.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
