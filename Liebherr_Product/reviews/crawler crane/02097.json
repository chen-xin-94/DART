The box on the left (labeled \"crane\") includes parts of the environment that are not part of the crane, and the box on the right (labeled \"crawler crane\") is too loose, including a significant amount of background.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (crawler cranes) in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are not well-fitted. The left bounding box is too loose, including parts of the environment, and the right bounding box is also too loose, including a significant amount of background.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
