The red bounding box encloses the left crawler crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right crawler crane. There is no significant occlusion that would require estimation.\n2. **Recall**: Both crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the crawler cranes well without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
