In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled \"crawler crane.\" Each bounding box seems to enclose a single crawler crane, although the red bounding box is slightly occluded by another crane. However, it still reasonably estimates the size of the crawler crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three crawler cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the crawler cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor cut-offs, which are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
