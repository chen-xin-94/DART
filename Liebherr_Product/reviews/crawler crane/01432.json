Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, as it includes a lot of unnecessary space around the crane and misses parts of the crane's base.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
