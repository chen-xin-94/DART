                "content": "1. **Precision**: The image shows a bounding box around a single crawler crane. The bounding box appears to enclose the entire crane without including other objects. Therefore, the bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It encloses the crawler crane well, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
