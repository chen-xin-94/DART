Therefore, the precision is correct.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are missed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes being slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
