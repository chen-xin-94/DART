It includes parts of the crane's surroundings and does not cover the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple crawler cranes in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose. It includes a significant portion of the surrounding area and does not tightly fit the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
