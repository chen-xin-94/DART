The annotations are accurate and do not include other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted to the crawler cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably estimate the size of the cranes, even if parts are occluded.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
