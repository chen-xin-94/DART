There is no overlap with other objects, and the crane is well-contained within the box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crawler crane well, with only minor parts of the crane slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
