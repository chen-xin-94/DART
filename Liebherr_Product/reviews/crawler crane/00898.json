Both boxes are correctly identifying the target objects without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the crawler cranes well, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
