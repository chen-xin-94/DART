The crane is tall and the bounding box captures its entire structure, including the base and the extended arm. There is no other object within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it is not excessively so. It captures the entire height and width of the crane without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
