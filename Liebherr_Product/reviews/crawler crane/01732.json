However, the bounding box on the left (purple) seems to be slightly off as it includes part of the building at the bottom. The other two bounding boxes (pink and red) seem to enclose the cranes accurately.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three crawler cranes in the image, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left (purple) is slightly loose as it includes part of the building. The other two bounding boxes (pink and red) fit well around the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
