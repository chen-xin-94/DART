Both bounding boxes correctly enclose the respective crawler cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the crawler cranes. The larger crane's bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it is within acceptable limits. The smaller crane's bounding box is well-fitted.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
