In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the crawler cranes, but the bounding box on the left (pink) also includes part of a wind turbine, which is not part of the crawler crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are three crawler cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes generally fit the crawler cranes well, though the leftmost bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of a wind turbine.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
