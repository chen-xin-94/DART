The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box captures the entire structure, including the boom and the base.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane, but it is not excessively loose. It captures the entire crane without cutting off any part of it.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
