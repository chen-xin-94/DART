In this image, each bounding box does seem to enclose a single crawler crane, even if some parts of the cranes are occluded or partially outside the frame. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible crawler cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image are generally well-fitted to the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and partial visibility.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
