It seems to be focused on a part of the crane, specifically the vertical structure, but not the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple crawler cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire crawler crane. It only covers a part of the crane, which is not sufficient.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
