Therefore, the precision is not correct.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one crawler crane in the image that is not localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is not correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box does not fit the target object (crawler crane) at all, as it is enclosing a different object (wind turbine).\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
