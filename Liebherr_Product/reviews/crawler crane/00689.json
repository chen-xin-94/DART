However, the bounding box for the crawler crane on the left side of the image is too loose and includes a significant portion of the surrounding area. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Both crawler cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the crawler crane on the right side of the image fits well. The bounding box for the crawler crane on the left side of the image is too loose and includes unnecessary surrounding areas.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
