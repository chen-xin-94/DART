The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred even though parts of the cranes are occluded or extend beyond the image frame.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes extending beyond the bounding boxes, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
