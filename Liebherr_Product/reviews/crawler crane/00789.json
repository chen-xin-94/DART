The crane is tall and narrow, and the bounding box seems to cover its entire structure, including the base and the extended arm. There is no significant part of another object within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose at the top and bottom, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably covers the entire crane without cutting off significant parts of it.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
