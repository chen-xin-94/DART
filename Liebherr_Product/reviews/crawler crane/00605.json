Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose just one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose, including parts of other objects and machinery. It could be tighter to better fit the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
