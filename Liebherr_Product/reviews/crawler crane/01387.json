It seems to be enclosing only a part of the crane, missing significant portions of it.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (crawler cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is at least one visible crawler crane in the image that is not fully enclosed by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire crawler crane, making it an incorrect fit.",
