The crane is partially occluded by the wind turbine, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it is not excessively so. It reasonably fits the crane without being too tight or too loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
