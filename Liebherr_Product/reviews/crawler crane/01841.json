The bounding boxes are well-placed and do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the crawler cranes appropriately, with minimal cutting off or inclusion of outside areas.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
