Therefore, the precision is not correct.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the purple bounding box. The red bounding box is incorrect as it does not enclose a crawler crane.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box is slightly loose but acceptable as it encloses the entire crawler crane. The red bounding box is irrelevant as it does not enclose a crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
