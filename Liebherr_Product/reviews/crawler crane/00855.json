However, it also includes some surrounding objects and space, which means it is not perfectly precise.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is a bit loose, including some extra space around the crawler crane. It could be tighter to better fit the object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
