The crane is well-defined within the box, and the box does not extend beyond the crane unnecessarily.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crane well, covering the entire structure without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
