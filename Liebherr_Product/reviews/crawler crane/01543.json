The red bounding box encloses the left crawler crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right crawler crane. There is no significant part of any other object within these bounding boxes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (crawler cranes) in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the crawler cranes, with slight allowances for the crane's extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
