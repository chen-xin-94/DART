The boxes are well-placed around each crane, even if some parts are occluded or partially visible.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no cranes left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes appropriately, with slight allowances for occlusion and partial visibility.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
