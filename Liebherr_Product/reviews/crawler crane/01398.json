                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, the left bounding box (purple) seems to enclose a single crawler crane accurately. The right bounding box (red) also encloses a single crawler crane accurately. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual crawler cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) fits well around the crawler crane, and the right bounding box (red) also fits well around the other crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized, not too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
