This makes the bounding box slightly loose but still reasonable.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, especially at the top and bottom, but it is not excessively so. It still reasonably fits the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
