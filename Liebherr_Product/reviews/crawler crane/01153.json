In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the crawler cranes, but the box on the left is slightly loose, including some extra space around the crane. The box on the right is more precise but slightly cuts off the crane's base. However, both boxes reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box is a bit loose, and the right bounding box is slightly tight at the base. However, these are minor issues and the boxes generally fit the cranes well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
