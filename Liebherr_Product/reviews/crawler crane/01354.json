Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one crawler crane each, even though parts of the cranes are occluded by other objects or each other. The bounding boxes are reasonably inferred.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusions and extensions.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
