In this image, the left bounding box (purple) does not perfectly enclose a single crawler crane; it includes parts of other structures. The right bounding box (red) also does not perfectly enclose a single crawler crane; it includes parts of the gantry crane. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is met.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) is too loose as it includes parts of other structures. The right bounding box (red) is also too loose as it includes parts of the gantry crane. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
