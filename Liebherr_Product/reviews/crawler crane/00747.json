The boxes are drawn around the cranes, even though parts of the cranes are occluded or extend beyond the box, the bounding boxes are reasonably estimated.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with slight allowances for occlusions and extensions.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
