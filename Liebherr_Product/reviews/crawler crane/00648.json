In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the crawler cranes, but the leftmost bounding box (red) also includes part of the crane's boom, which is not part of the crawler crane itself. The middle bounding box (red) is correctly enclosing the crawler crane. The rightmost bounding box (purple) also correctly encloses the crawler crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible crawler cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The leftmost bounding box (red) is slightly loose as it includes part of the crane's boom. The middle bounding box (red) and the rightmost bounding box (purple) fit well around the crawler cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
