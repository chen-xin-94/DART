In this image, the bounding box does enclose a crawler crane, but it also includes some parts of the surrounding environment. However, it is not too loose or too tight, and it reasonably covers the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose but not excessively so. It reasonably fits the crawler crane without cutting off significant parts of it.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
