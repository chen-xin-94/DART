Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual crawler cranes.\n2. **Recall**: There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box fits well around the crawler crane, neither too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box also fits well around the other crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
