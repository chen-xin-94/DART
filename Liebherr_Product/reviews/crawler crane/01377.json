The red bounding box is more precise but still includes a bit of the surrounding area.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the purple one, which includes a significant portion of the boom extending outside the main body of the crane.
