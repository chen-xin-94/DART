In this image, the red bounding box labeled \"crawler crane\" and the purple bounding box labeled \"crawler\" both enclose the same crawler crane. This means that the bounding boxes are not perfectly enclosing one single target object each, as they overlap and cover the same object.\n\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one crawler crane, and it is localized by the bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the crawler crane, although they overlap.\n\nBased on the above analysis, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
