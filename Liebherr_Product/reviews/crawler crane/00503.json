Therefore, it does not meet the precision requirement.\n2. **Recall**: Not all parts of the crawler crane are localized by a bounding box. The upper section of the crane is not included in the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it only encloses a part of the crawler crane and does not cover the entire object.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
