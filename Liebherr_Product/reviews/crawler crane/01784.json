In this image, there are three bounding boxes labeled as \"crawler crane.\" The first bounding box (0.57) correctly encloses a crawler crane. The second bounding box (0.65) also correctly encloses a crawler crane. The third bounding box (0.65) correctly encloses another crawler crane. Therefore, each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are three crawler cranes, and all three are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted to the crawler cranes, with no significant parts of the cranes being cut off or excessive outside areas being included.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
