The red bounding box also encloses one crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the crawler crane, and the red bounding box also fits well around the other crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
