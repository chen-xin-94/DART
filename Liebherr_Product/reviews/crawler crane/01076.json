In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the crawler cranes, but the left bounding box also includes part of the building structure, which is not part of the crane. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding box on the left is too loose as it includes part of the building structure. The bounding box on the right is well-fitted to the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
