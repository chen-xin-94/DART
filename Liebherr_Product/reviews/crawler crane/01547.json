The bounding box labeled \"crawler crane\" in red does enclose a crawler crane. Therefore, not all bounding boxes perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The red bounding box around the crawler crane is slightly loose but generally acceptable. The purple bounding box is not relevant to the target object.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
