The entire crane is within the box, and no other objects are included.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some extra space around the crane. However, it is not excessively loose, and the entire crane is well within the box.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
