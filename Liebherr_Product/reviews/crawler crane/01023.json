However, it is not perfectly enclosing the entire crane, as the base of the crane is cut off.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight at the bottom, cutting off part of the crane's base. The top part of the crane is well enclosed.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
