In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual crawler cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is good.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is good.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the crawler cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they cover the cranes adequately.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
