Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the respective crawler cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the crawler cranes. The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right both seem to reasonably enclose the cranes without significant portions being cut off or excessive empty space.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
