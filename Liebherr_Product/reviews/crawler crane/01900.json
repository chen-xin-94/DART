The box is well-aligned with the crane's structure, even though parts of the crane are occluded by other parts of the crane itself.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire crawler crane, including the extended arm, without cutting off any significant parts or including excessive background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
