The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right both correctly identify individual crawler cranes. There is no significant occlusion that would make the bounding boxes inaccurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes in the image that are left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They encompass the entirety of each crawler crane without cutting off significant parts or including too much extraneous background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
