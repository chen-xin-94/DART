The right bounding box (purple) also correctly encloses a single crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are precise in identifying individual crawler cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (red) is slightly loose but acceptable. The right bounding box (purple) fits well around the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
