However, it includes a significant portion of the background, which is not part of the target object. This reduces the precision.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, as it includes a lot of empty space around the crane, especially at the top and sides.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
