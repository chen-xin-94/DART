The larger purple bounding box encloses the entire crane, including the extended arm, and the smaller red bounding box also accurately encloses the smaller crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the cranes without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the cranes, including the extended arms and the base, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
