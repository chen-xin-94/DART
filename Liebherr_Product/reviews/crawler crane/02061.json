Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple crawler cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose, including parts of other objects and background. It could be tighter to better fit the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
