The boxes are drawn around the cranes, including their booms and bases.\n2. **Recall**: There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, including the booms and bases, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
