The purple bounding box correctly encloses a single crawler crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are two crawler cranes in the image, but only one is correctly localized by a bounding box (the purple one). The red bounding box does not correctly localize the other crawler crane.\n3. **Fit**: The purple bounding box fits well around the crawler crane, neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box is too loose and includes unnecessary parts of the image.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
