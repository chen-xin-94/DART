However, it does not perfectly enclose the entire crane, as parts of the crane are outside the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not fully enclose the entire crane, especially the base and some parts of the arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
