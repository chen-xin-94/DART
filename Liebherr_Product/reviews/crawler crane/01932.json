The crane is fully within the box, and the box does not include significant portions of the background or other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler crane, including its extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
