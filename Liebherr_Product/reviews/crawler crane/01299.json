In this image, the red bounding box and the purple bounding box each enclose one crawler crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box and the purple bounding box both fit their respective crawler cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes being cut off or a small amount of extra space around them.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
