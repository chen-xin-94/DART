It does not include any other objects, so it meets the precision criterion.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. Therefore, recall is satisfied.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits the crawler crane well. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the entire object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
