It appears to be too small and only covers a part of the crane's structure.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (crawler cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There is a large crawler crane in the center of the image that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and does not cover the entire crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
