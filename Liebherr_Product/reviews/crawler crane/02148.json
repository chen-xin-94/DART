The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible crawler cranes are enclosed within bounding boxes. There are no additional crawler cranes that are left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the crawler cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they account for the entire structure of the cranes, including the booms.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
