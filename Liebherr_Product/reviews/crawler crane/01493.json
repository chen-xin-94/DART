Each box contains one crawler crane, and the boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with only slight deviations that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
