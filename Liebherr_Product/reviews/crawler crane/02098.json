The one on the right (purple box) is more accurate but still includes some extra space at the top.\n2. **Recall**: Both crawler cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, especially the red one, which includes extra space at the bottom. The purple one is also a bit loose at the top.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
