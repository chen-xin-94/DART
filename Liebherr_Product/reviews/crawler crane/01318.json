The purple bounding box encloses the red crawler crane, and the red bounding box encloses the yellow crawler crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around the cranes, even though parts of the cranes are occluded by other objects or extend beyond the image frame. The bounding boxes are inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the cranes.\n2. **Recall**: Both visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other crawler cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
