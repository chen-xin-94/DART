It includes multiple cranes and other objects within the same bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (crawler cranes) are not localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes other objects and does not tightly fit around a single crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
