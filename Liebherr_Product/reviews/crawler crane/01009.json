Both boxes are correctly identifying single target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible crawler cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional crawler cranes that are missed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They reasonably enclose the crawler cranes, even considering the occlusion and the height of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
