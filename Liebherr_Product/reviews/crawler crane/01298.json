The box is drawn around the entire crane, including its tracks and the main body, which is correct.\n2. **Recall:** There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler crane, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive empty space around it.",
