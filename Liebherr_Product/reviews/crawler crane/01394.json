However, the bounding box labeled \"crawler\" does not seem to be relevant to the target object (crawler crane). Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the crawler crane is slightly loose but generally fits the object well enough.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
