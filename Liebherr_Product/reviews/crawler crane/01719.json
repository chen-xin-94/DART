Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, recall is correct.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the wind turbine and the surrounding area. It should be tighter around the crawler crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
