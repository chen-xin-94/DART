Both bounding boxes accurately enclose one crawler crane each, without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two crawler cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the crawler cranes, with slight allowances for the crane's extended parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
