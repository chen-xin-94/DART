Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose the cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (crawler cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two crawler cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the cranes well, with a slight margin that is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
