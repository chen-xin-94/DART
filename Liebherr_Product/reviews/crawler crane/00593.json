However, some bounding boxes are overlapping, which might indicate that they are not perfectly enclosing individual cranes. Despite this, each box does contain a crawler crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible crawler cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image appear to be reasonably well-fitted to the crawler cranes, with slight overlaps and minor cut-offs that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
