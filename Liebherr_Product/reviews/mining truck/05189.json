There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is well-placed around the truck.\n2. **Recall**: There are two mining trucks in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining truck, capturing the entire object without significant extra space or cutting off parts of the truck.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
