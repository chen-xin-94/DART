The box is reasonably inferred to cover the entire truck, even though parts of it are occluded by other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining truck in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining trucks or excavators visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining truck, with slight allowances for occlusions and minor cut-offs.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
