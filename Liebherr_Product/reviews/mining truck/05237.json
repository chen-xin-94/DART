The bounding box for the mining excavator also accurately encloses the excavator. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying one single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining truck and the mining excavator are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining trucks or excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the target objects well, with only minor parts of the objects potentially being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
