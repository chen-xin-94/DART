The bounding box labeled \"mining truck\" is enclosing a car, which is incorrect. Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: There is one mining truck in the image, but it is incorrectly labeled as a mining excavator. There are no mining excavators in the image. Therefore, recall is not met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box labeled \"mining excavator\" fits the mining truck well, but the label is incorrect. The bounding box labeled \"mining truck\" fits the car well, but the label is incorrect.
