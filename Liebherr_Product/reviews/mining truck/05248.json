However, the bounding box for the mining truck is not accurate as it includes part of the excavator. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (one mining excavator and one mining truck) are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box for the mining excavator fits well. The bounding box for the mining truck is too loose as it includes part of the excavator.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
