The bounding box for the mining excavator also encloses the excavator accurately. Therefore, each bounding box encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining truck and the mining excavator are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining trucks or excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the respective objects, with only slight margins that are acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
