However, it is reasonable given the shape and position of the excavator.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - All visible target objects (one mining truck and one mining excavator) are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box for the mining excavator is slightly loose but acceptable as it reasonably encloses the object.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
