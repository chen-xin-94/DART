Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains both a mining truck and a mining excavator. The mining truck is localized by a bounding box, but the mining excavator is not. Therefore, recall is not perfect.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the mining excavator. It should be more tightly fitted to the mining truck.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
