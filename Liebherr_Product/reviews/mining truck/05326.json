There are no other objects within the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining truck in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining trucks or mining excavators visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately encloses the mining truck without cutting off significant parts of the object or including too much outside area.\n\nHere is the evaluation in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
