However, it does not include any other objects.\n   - The bounding box for the \"mining excavator\" encloses the excavator well, though it slightly cuts off the bottom part of the excavator. It does not include any other objects.\n   - Both bounding boxes enclose only one target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There is one mining truck and one mining excavator in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box for the \"mining truck\" is slightly tight, cutting off the front and rear parts of the truck.\n   - The bounding box for the \"mining excavator\" is slightly tight, cutting off the bottom part of the excavator.\n   - Both bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, though slightly tight.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box encloses one single target object without including other objects.\n- **Recall**: Yes, because all target objects (one mining truck and one mining excavator) are localized by bounding boxes.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, though slightly tight, but within acceptable limits.",
