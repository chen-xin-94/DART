There are no additional mining trucks or excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box for the mining excavator is also well-fitted, covering the entire excavator including its arm and bucket.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
