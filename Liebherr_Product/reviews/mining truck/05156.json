However, this is acceptable as the main body of the excavator is enclosed.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - Both the mining truck and the mining excavator are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining trucks or excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box for the mining truck is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box for the mining excavator is slightly loose, but it is acceptable as it captures the main body of the excavator.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
