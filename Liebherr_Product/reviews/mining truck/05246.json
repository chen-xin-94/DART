The mining truck is fully within the red bounding box, and the mining excavator is fully within the purple bounding box. There is no significant part of either object outside their respective bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both target objects (mining truck and mining excavator) present in the image are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining trucks or mining excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The edges of the bounding boxes slightly cut off the objects, but this is within acceptable limits and does not significantly affect the accuracy of the annotations.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
