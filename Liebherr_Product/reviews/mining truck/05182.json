Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all mining trucks are localized by a bounding box. There is a mining truck in the background that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the mining truck in the foreground is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
