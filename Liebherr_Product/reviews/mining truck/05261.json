Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one mining truck and one mining excavator. The mining truck is localized by a bounding box, but the mining excavator is not.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the mining excavator, but it is not excessively loose or tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
