The bounding box for the mining excavator (purple box) also correctly encloses the excavator. Both bounding boxes are correctly placed around their respective objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining truck and the mining excavator are localized by bounding boxes. There are no other mining trucks or excavators in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the objects, with only minor acceptable deviations.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
