There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is well-placed around the truck.\n2. **Recall**: All visible mining trucks in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no mining excavators in the image, so this criterion is met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the mining truck without cutting off significant parts of the truck or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
