The mining truck is fully enclosed within the red bounding box, and the mining excavator is fully enclosed within the purple bounding box. There is no significant part of either object outside the bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining truck and the mining excavator are localized by bounding boxes. There are no additional mining trucks or mining excavators in the image that are not enclosed by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box for the mining truck and the purple bounding box for the mining excavator both fit well around the objects, with only minor parts of the objects potentially being cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
