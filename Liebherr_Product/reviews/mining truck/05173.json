There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is well-placed around the truck.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining truck in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining trucks or mining excavators visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the mining truck, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the truck.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
