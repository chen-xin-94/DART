The bounding box for the mining excavator (red) also encloses the excavator accurately. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying single target objects.\n2. **Recall**: Both the mining truck and the mining excavator present in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the respective objects, with only minor acceptable deviations.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
