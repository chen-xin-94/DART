The mining truck is clearly visible and the bounding box is well-placed around it.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining truck in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no other mining trucks or excavators that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the mining truck, capturing the entire object without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
