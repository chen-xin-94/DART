There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is well-placed around the truck.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one mining truck in the image, and it is correctly localized by a bounding box. There are no mining excavators present in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the mining truck, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
