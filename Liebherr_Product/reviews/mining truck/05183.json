There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is correctly placed around the truck.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple mining trucks in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is well-fitted around the mining truck. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it accurately captures the dimensions of the truck.\n\nBased on this evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
