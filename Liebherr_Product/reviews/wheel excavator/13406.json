The bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel excavators in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are reasonably well-fitted to the wheel excavators, with only minor areas slightly outside the objects, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
