In this image, there are two bounding boxes, and each one encloses a single wheel excavator. The larger bounding box encloses the main wheel excavator in the foreground, and the smaller bounding box encloses the wheel excavator in the image on the right side. Both bounding boxes correctly enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two wheel excavators, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The larger bounding box around the main wheel excavator in the foreground is well-fitted, not too loose or too tight. The smaller bounding box around the wheel excavator in the image on the right side is also well-fitted.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
