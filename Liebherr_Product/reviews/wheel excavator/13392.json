The annotations are clear and do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible wheel excavators in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel excavators, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the wheel excavators well, with only minimal and acceptable cut-offs or extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
