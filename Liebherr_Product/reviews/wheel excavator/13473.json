The entire excavator is within the box, and the box is not too loose or too tight.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one wheel excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box fits well around the wheel excavator, neither cutting off parts of the excavator nor including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
