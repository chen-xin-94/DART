In this image, each bounding box encloses one wheel excavator without including other objects. The bounding boxes are correctly placed around the wheel excavators.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two wheel excavators in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to fit well around the wheel excavators, with a slight margin that does not cut off significant parts of the objects or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
