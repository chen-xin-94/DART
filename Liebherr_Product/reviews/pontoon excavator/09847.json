The box includes parts of another structure and does not fully cover the pontoon excavator.\n2. **Recall:** Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is another pontoon excavator in the background that is not annotated.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box is too loose and includes parts of other structures, failing to tightly fit the pontoon excavator.",
