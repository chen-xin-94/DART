The entire excavator is within the box, and there is no occlusion to consider.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one pontoon excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the pontoon excavator, with slight margins that do not cut off any part of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
