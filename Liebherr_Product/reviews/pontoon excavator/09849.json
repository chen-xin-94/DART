The box is well-placed around the target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one pontoon excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the pontoon excavator, capturing the entire object without significant cut-offs or excessive outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
