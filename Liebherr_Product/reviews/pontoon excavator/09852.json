There is no overlap with other objects, and the box is well-placed around the target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one pontoon excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the pontoon excavator, capturing the entire object without significant extra space or cutting off parts of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
