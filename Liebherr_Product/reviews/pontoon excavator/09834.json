The box is well-placed around the excavator, even though parts of the excavator are occluded by other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one pontoon excavator in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the pontoon excavator, with only minor parts of the excavator being slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
