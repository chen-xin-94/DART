The bounding box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one pontoon excavator in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be well-fitted around the pontoon excavator. It is neither too loose nor too tight, and it reasonably encloses the entire object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
