The box is well-placed around the telescopic handler, even though part of the handler is occluded by the load it is carrying. This is acceptable as the bounding box reasonably estimates the size of the object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one telescopic handler in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the telescopic handler, capturing the entire object without significant parts being cut off or excessive outside area being included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
