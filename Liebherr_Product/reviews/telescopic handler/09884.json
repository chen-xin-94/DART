It only covers the arm of the handler, missing the main body. Therefore, it does not enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is another telescopic handler in the image that is not annotated. Hence, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the arm of the telescopic handler is too loose, as it includes a significant amount of background space and does not cover the main body of the handler. The other bounding box is also too loose and does not fit the object well.",
