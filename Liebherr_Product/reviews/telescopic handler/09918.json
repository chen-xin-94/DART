Both bounding boxes are drawn around the telescopic handlers, even though one is partially occluded by the other. The occlusion is handled well, and the bounding boxes are inferred correctly.\n2. **Recall**: Both telescopic handlers in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the telescopic handlers, capturing the entirety of the objects without significant overreach or underreach.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
