The box is well-placed around the telescopic handler, even though parts of it are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one telescopic handler in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the telescopic handler, even accounting for occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
