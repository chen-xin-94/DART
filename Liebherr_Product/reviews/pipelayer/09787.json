Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one pipelayer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area that is not part of the pipelayer.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
