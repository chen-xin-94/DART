The entire pipelayer is within the bounding box, and no other objects are included.\n2. **Recall:** There is only one pipelayer in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit:** The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the pipelayer, with only a slight margin around the edges, which is acceptable.",
