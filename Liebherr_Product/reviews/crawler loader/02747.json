The entire crawler loader is within the box, even though part of it is occluded by the terrain.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler loader, with only a minimal amount of extra space around the edges.",
