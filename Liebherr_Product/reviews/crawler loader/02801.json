The bounding box is inferred correctly based on the visible parts of the object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire crawler loader, including the occluded parts, without including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
