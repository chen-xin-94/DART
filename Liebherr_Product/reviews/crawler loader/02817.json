The object is partially occluded, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the size of the loader.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler loader, even considering the occlusion.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
