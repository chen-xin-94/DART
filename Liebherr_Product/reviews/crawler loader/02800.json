Although some parts of the loader are occluded, the bounding box reasonably estimates the size of the object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler loader, even though some parts are occluded.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
