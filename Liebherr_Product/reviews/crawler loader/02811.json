However, the crawler loader on the left side of the image is not annotated. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (crawler loaders) are localized by a bounding box. The crawler loader on the left side is missing an annotation.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the crawler loader on the right side is well-fitted, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
