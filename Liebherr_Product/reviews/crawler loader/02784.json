The box is well-placed around the loader, even though part of the loader is occluded by the wall on the left side. The occlusion is minimal and the bounding box is inferred correctly.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crawler loader, with slight tolerance for the edges.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
