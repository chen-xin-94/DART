The arm of the loader is also included, which is appropriate given its relevance to the object. Therefore, the bounding box does enclose one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one crawler loader in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It includes the entire crawler loader without cutting off significant parts of it or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
