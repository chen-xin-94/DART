Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one other log loader visible in the image (on the left side), which is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose, including parts of the surrounding environment. It could be tighter to better fit the log loader.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
