The log loader is not occluded, and the bounding box accurately captures the entire object.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one log loader in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the log loader, capturing the entire object without significant extra space or cutting off parts of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
