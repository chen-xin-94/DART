It includes a significant amount of background and other objects.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There is only one bounding box, and it is not clear if there are other bulldozers in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including a lot of unnecessary background and other objects, which means it does not fit the bulldozer well.",
