It includes a significant portion of the surrounding area and other objects, such as the person and parts of the environment.\n2. **Recall**: Not all bulldozers are localized by a bounding box. There is only one bounding box, and it does not accurately capture the bulldozer.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including a lot of unnecessary space around the bulldozer and other objects. It does not fit the bulldozer well.",
