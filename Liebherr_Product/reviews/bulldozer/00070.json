The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and are correctly placed around the bulldozers.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (bulldozers) in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are three bulldozers in the image, and each one is enclosed by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes accurately fit around the bulldozers, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space, which is acceptable.",
