The bounding box is inferred based on a reasonable estimation of the bulldozer's size.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one bulldozer in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the bulldozer, considering the occlusion by dirt.",
