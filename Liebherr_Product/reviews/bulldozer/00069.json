It includes a significant amount of background and other objects, which means it is not precise.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one bulldozer in the image, but the bounding box does not accurately localize it. Therefore, recall is not achieved.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including a lot of unnecessary background and other objects. It does not fit the bulldozer well.",
