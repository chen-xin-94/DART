                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. In this image, each bounding box does enclose a single maritime crane. The left bounding box (purple) encloses one crane, and the right bounding box (red) encloses another crane. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box (purple) is slightly loose but still reasonably fits the crane. The right bounding box (red) is also slightly loose but reasonably fits the crane. Therefore, the fit is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
