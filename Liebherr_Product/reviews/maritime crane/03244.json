The purple bounding box also correctly encloses another maritime crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual maritime cranes.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box fits well around the maritime crane, and the purple bounding box also fits well around the other maritime crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
