It includes parts of two cranes, which affects the precision.\n2. **Recall**: Not all maritime cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the area it covers, but it does not fit a single crane properly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
