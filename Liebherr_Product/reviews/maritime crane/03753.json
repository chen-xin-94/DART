In this image, both bounding boxes correctly enclose individual maritime cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the maritime cranes well, with no significant parts of the cranes being cut off or excessive empty space within the boxes. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
