However, it also includes parts of other objects, such as the crane's cables and some surrounding structures. This makes the bounding box not perfectly precise.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly too loose, as it includes some surrounding structures and cables. It could be tighter to better fit the maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
