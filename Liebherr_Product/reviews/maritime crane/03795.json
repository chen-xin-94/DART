The one on the right (red) is more accurate but includes a bit of the surrounding area. Overall, they do enclose the cranes but not perfectly.\n2. **Recall**: Both maritime cranes in the image are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box on the left is slightly too tight, and the one on the right is slightly too loose. However, they are not excessively so.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
