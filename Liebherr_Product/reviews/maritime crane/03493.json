The left bounding box (purple) and the right bounding box (red) each enclose one maritime crane without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image appear to fit the maritime cranes well. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
