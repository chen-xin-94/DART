The crane is partially occluded by other structures, and the bounding box does not fully capture the entire crane. However, it does enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some surrounding structures and does not tightly fit the crane. However, it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
