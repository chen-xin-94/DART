Recall: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. Fit: The bounding box is slightly loose but not excessively so. It reasonably fits the maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
