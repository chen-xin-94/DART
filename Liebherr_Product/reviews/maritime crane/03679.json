Instead, it encloses a large portion of the offshore platform, which includes other structures besides the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one bounding box, and it does not accurately localize the maritime crane. Therefore, not all target objects are localized correctly.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a significant portion of the offshore platform and not just the maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
