Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is another maritime crane on the right side of the image that is not annotated. Hence, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the ship and other structures, not just the maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
