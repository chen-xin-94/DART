Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one other maritime crane visible in the image that is not enclosed by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is somewhat loose as it includes parts of the structure that are not part of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
