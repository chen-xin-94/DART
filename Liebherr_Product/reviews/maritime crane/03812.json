The purple and red bounding boxes each enclose one maritime crane. However, the blue bounding box seems to enclose parts of two cranes, which is not precise.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. There are three maritime cranes in the image, and all three are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple and red bounding boxes fit well around the cranes. The blue bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of two cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
