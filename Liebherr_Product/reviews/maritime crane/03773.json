In the image, the red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right each enclose a single maritime crane. Both bounding boxes seem to be correctly placed around the cranes without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the left and the purple bounding box on the right both fit well around the maritime cranes. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
