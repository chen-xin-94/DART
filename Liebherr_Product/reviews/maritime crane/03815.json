                "content": "1. **Precision**: The image shows two bounding boxes, each enclosing a maritime crane. Both bounding boxes seem to perfectly enclose one single target object each, without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They accurately enclose the cranes, with a reasonable margin that does not cut off significant parts of the cranes or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
