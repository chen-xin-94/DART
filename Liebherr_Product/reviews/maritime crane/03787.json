In the image, each bounding box seems to enclose one maritime crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly and seem to be focused on individual cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are four maritime cranes visible in the image, and all four are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the maritime cranes. They are not excessively loose and do not cut off significant parts of the cranes.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
