It includes parts of multiple cranes and other objects.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple maritime cranes, but only one bounding box is present. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of multiple cranes and other objects, not just a single maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
