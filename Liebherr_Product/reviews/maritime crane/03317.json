In the image, there are two bounding boxes, and each one encloses a single maritime crane without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the maritime cranes well, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the JSON output is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
