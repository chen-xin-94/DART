There is no significant occlusion, and the bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red and blue bounding boxes fit well around the maritime cranes, with only slight areas of the outside environment included, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
