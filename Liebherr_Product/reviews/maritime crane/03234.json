This means the bounding box is not perfectly enclosing just the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the structure below the crane. It could be tighter to better fit the crane itself.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
