It includes parts of the structure that are not part of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects (maritime cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There could be more cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, including a significant amount of background and other structures, which means it does not fit the target object well.",
