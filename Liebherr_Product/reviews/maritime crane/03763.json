The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box accurately captures the entire crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are two maritime cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crane.\n\nBased on the above observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
