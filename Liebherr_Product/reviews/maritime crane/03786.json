The annotations are clear and each box contains one crane without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no cranes left unannotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted around the cranes. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes even if some parts are slightly cut off or some extra space is included.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
