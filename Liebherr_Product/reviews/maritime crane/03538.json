The red bounding box encloses the left crane, and the purple bounding box encloses the right crane. There is no overlap or inclusion of other objects within the bounding boxes.\n2. **Recall:** All target objects (maritime cranes) in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes, and both are annotated.\n3. **Fit:** Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes accurately cover the cranes, with slight allowances for minor cut-offs or extra space, which is acceptable.",
