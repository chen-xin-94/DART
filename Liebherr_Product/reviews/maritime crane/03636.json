Therefore, the precision is not met.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains one maritime crane, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, the recall is met.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight and only encloses a part of the crane structure. Therefore, the fit is not met.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
