In this image, there are two bounding boxes, each enclosing a single maritime crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and seem to be correctly placed around the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit well around the maritime cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes or include too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
