However, the right bounding box is too loose and includes parts of the container and other structures, not just the crane.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The left bounding box fits well around the crane, but the right bounding box is too loose, including unnecessary parts of the image.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
