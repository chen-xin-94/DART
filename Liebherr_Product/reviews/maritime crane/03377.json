The left bounding box (red) encloses one crane, and the right bounding box (purple) encloses another crane. Both bounding boxes are correctly identifying individual cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image are reasonably well-fitted to the cranes. The red bounding box is slightly loose at the bottom, but it is acceptable. The purple bounding box is well-fitted to the crane.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
