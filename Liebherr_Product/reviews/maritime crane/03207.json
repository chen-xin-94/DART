Therefore, it is not possible to determine if each bounding box perfectly encloses one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are no bounding boxes present in the image, so no target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: Since there are no bounding boxes, it is not possible to evaluate if each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nGiven these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
