In the image, both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose individual maritime cranes without including other objects. Therefore, the precision is correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is correct.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the maritime cranes well, without being excessively loose or tight. Therefore, the fit is correct.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
