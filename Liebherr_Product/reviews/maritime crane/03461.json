In this image, the bounding boxes do enclose the maritime cranes, but the leftmost bounding box also includes parts of another crane and some background elements. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible maritime cranes are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are generally well-fitted, but the leftmost bounding box is a bit loose as it includes parts of another crane and some background elements.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
