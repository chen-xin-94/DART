The crane is clearly visible and the bounding box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is another maritime crane on the left side of the image that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is well-fitted around the maritime crane. It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
