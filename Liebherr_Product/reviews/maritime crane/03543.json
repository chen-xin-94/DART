There are two maritime cranes in the image, but only one bounding box is drawn around both of them.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes, but only one bounding box is present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the two cranes it encloses, but since it should enclose only one crane, it is not a perfect fit.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
