Instead, it encloses the entire ship, which includes multiple cranes and other structures. Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) are localized by the bounding box, but they are not individually annotated. This means that while the cranes are within the bounding box, they are not distinctly identified.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the ship, but since it is supposed to enclose individual maritime cranes, it does not fit the requirement correctly.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
