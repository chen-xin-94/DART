Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: Not all maritime cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are at least three maritime cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box around the annotated maritime crane is reasonably well-fitted. It is neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
