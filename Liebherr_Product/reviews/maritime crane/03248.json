The crane is partially occluded by other structures, making it difficult to determine if the bounding box is perfectly enclosing the crane.\n\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated with a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box appears to be reasonably well-fitted to the visible part of the crane, but it is slightly loose as it includes some surrounding structures.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
