                "content": "1. **Precision**: The bounding boxes should perfectly enclose one single target object. The purple bounding box correctly encloses one maritime crane. The red bounding box also encloses one maritime crane, but it includes part of another crane in the background. Therefore, the precision is not perfect.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box fits well around the crane. The red bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of another crane in the background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
