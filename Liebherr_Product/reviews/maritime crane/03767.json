Instead, it encloses the entire ship, which includes multiple cranes and other structures. Therefore, the bounding box is not precise.\n2. **Recall**: The image contains multiple maritime cranes, but only one bounding box is present. This means not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it encloses the entire ship rather than just the maritime cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
