It includes parts of the ship and other structures along with the maritime crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are multiple maritime cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the ship and other structures, not just the maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
