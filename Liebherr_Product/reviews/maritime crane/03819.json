However, there are multiple maritime cranes in the image, and only one is annotated.\n2. **Recall**: Not all maritime cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are at least two other maritime cranes in the image that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight; it fits the annotated maritime crane well.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
