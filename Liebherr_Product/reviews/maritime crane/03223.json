Therefore, they do not perfectly enclose only the target objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are slightly loose, including some extra elements around the cranes, but they are not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
