The boxes are reasonably inferred even though the cranes are partially occluded by the lighting and other structures. Therefore, the precision is good.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional cranes that are missed.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They enclose the cranes well, with only minor parts of the cranes being cut off or extra space included, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
