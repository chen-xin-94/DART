Therefore, the precision is not accurate.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) are localized by the bounding box, but they are not individually annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the two cranes it encloses, but since it should enclose only one crane per box, the fit is not correct.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
