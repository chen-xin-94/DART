The box does not include any other objects and is reasonably inferred for the occluded parts.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the maritime crane, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
