There are no maritime cranes left unannotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The first bounding box (purple) fits well around the maritime crane, not too loose or too tight.\n   - The second bounding box (red) fits well around the maritime crane, not too loose or too tight.\n   - The third bounding box (pink) fits well around the maritime crane, not too loose or too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
