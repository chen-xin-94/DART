The box does not include any other objects and is reasonably inferred for the occluded parts.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the maritime crane, with slight allowances for occlusion and estimation.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
