Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose a single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes parts of the ship and the dock, which are not part of the maritime crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
