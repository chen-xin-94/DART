In this image, the red bounding box on the right encloses the yellow maritime crane accurately. The purple bounding box on the left also encloses a maritime crane accurately. Both bounding boxes do not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red bounding box on the right fits well around the yellow maritime crane, and the purple bounding box on the left fits well around the other maritime crane. Both bounding boxes are appropriately sized.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
