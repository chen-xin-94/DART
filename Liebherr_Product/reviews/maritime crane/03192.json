The left bounding box includes parts of two cranes, and the right bounding box includes parts of the structure and another crane.\n2. **Recall**: Not all maritime cranes are localized by a bounding box. There are at least three cranes visible, but only two bounding boxes are present.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are too loose. They include significant portions of the surrounding structures and other cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
