In the image, there are two bounding boxes, and each one encloses a single maritime crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly and seem to be correctly placed around the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in the image appear to fit the maritime cranes well. They are not excessively loose or tight, and they reasonably enclose the cranes.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
