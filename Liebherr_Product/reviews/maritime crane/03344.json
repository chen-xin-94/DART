There is no significant occlusion, and the box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits the maritime crane, with only minor edges slightly cutting off or enclosing a bit of the outside area, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
