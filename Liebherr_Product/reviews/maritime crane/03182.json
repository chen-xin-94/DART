The crane is partially occluded by the ship's structure, and the bounding box does not fully capture the entire crane. However, it does not enclose any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes visible on the ship, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose, as it includes some parts of the ship's structure and does not tightly fit the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
