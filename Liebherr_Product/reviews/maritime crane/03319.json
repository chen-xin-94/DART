In this image, the purple bounding box on the left correctly encloses one maritime crane. However, the red bounding box on the right encloses two maritime cranes, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box on the left fits well around the maritime crane. The red bounding box on the right is too loose as it includes two maritime cranes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
