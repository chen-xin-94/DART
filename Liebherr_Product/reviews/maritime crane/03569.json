The red and purple bounding boxes each enclose one maritime crane without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes fit well around the maritime cranes, with slight allowances for the crane's structure.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
