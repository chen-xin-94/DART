In this image, there are two bounding boxes, and each one encloses a single maritime crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects and seem to be correctly placed around the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two visible maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes in this image appear to fit well around the maritime cranes, with a slight margin that does not cut off any significant part of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
