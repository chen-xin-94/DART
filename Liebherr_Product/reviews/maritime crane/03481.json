However, the bounding box on the left (red) is slightly loose, including some background area. The bounding box on the right (purple) is also slightly loose but still reasonably accurate.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are more maritime cranes visible that are not annotated. Specifically, the two large cranes in the center of the image are not annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes are slightly loose but not excessively so. They do not cut off significant parts of the cranes.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"No\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```\n\n- **Precision**: Yes, because each bounding box does enclose a single maritime crane, even though they are slightly loose.\n- **Recall**: No, because not all maritime cranes in the image are annotated.\n- **Fit**: Yes, because the bounding boxes are reasonably accurate, even though they are slightly loose.",
