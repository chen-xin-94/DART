In this image, both bounding boxes (purple and red) each enclose a single maritime crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The purple bounding box is slightly loose at the top, but it still reasonably encloses the crane. The red bounding box fits well around the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
