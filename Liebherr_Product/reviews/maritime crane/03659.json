It includes part of the crane but also a significant portion of the surrounding area, including parts of the platform.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes visible in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose as it includes a lot of the surrounding area and not just the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
