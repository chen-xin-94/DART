There are two maritime cranes visible in the image, and only one is annotated.\n2. **Recall**: Not all target objects are localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes visible, but only one is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight for the crane it encloses. It fits well around the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
