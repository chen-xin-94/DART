The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box accurately captures the entire structure of the crane.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes in the image, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the crane, capturing its full structure without significant excess space or cutting off parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
