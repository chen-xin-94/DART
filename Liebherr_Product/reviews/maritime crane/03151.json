The bounding boxes are either too loose or too tight, and some of them overlap multiple cranes. Therefore, the precision is not satisfactory.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, all visible maritime cranes are localized by bounding boxes. Therefore, the recall is satisfactory.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. In this image, the bounding boxes are not well-fitted. Some bounding boxes are too loose, enclosing more than just the crane, while others are too tight, cutting off parts of the cranes.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"No\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
