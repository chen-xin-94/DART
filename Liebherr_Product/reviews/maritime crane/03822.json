The crane's arm extends beyond the bounding box.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes visible on the ship, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too tight as it cuts off part of the crane's arm.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
