Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose one single target object.\n2. **Recall**: There is another maritime crane on the right side of the ship that is not annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of the ship structure that are not part of the crane. It could be tighter to better fit the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
