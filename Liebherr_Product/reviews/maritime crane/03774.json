Therefore, it does not perfectly enclose just the target object.\n2. **Recall**: There are two maritime cranes visible on the ship, but only one is annotated. Therefore, not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes part of the ship's deck, but it is not excessively loose.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
