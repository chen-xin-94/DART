The right bounding box also encloses a single maritime crane accurately. Both bounding boxes perfectly enclose one single target object each.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There are no additional maritime cranes that are not annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the maritime cranes, with slight allowances for the structure and possible occlusions.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
