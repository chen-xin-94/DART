The entire structure of the crane, including the base and the extended arm, is within the bounding box. There is no significant part of the crane outside the bounding box, and no other objects are included within the box.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box. No other maritime cranes are present in the image.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits the crane, including the extended arm and the base, without cutting off any significant parts or including too much extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
