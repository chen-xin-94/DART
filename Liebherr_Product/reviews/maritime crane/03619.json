There is no overlap with other objects, and the crane is well-contained within the box.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box. There is only one crane in the image, and it is annotated.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crane well, with minimal outside area included and no significant parts of the crane cut off.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
