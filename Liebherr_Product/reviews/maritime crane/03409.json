The crane is well-defined within the box, and the occlusion is minimal.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crane well, with slight allowances for minor occlusions and external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
