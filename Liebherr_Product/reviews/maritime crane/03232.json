The crane is not occluded, and the bounding box does not include any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple maritime cranes in the image, but only one is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, not all target objects are localized.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crane well, covering the entire structure without significant overreach or underreach.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
