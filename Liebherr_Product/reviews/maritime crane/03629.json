The crane is partially occluded by other structures, but the bounding box reasonably estimates the crane's size. Therefore, the bounding box does enclose one single target object.\n\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. Therefore, all target objects are localized.\n\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the maritime crane, considering the occlusion and the visible parts of the crane.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
