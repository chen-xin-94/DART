The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly and seem to be focused on the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. There are two maritime cranes in the image, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The red and purple bounding boxes appear to fit the maritime cranes well, without cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much extra space.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
