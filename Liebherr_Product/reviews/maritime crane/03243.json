There are three maritime cranes, and all three are annotated.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The bounding box labeled \"maritime crane 0.61\" (red) on the left side of the image fits well around the crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"maritime crane 0.57\" (red) in the middle of the image fits well around the crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n   - The bounding box labeled \"maritime crane 0.61\" (purple) on the left side of the image fits well around the crane, neither too loose nor too tight.\n\nBased on the above evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
