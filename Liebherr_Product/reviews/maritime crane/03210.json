Both bounding boxes seem to correctly enclose one single maritime crane each, without including other objects.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects should be localized by a bounding box. In this image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the maritime cranes, with no significant parts of the cranes being cut off or excessive empty space within the boxes.\n\nBased on the above observations:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
