There is no other maritime crane in the image, so the bounding box does not overlap with any other objects.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It captures the entire crane, including the extended arm and the grabber, without cutting off any significant parts of the crane or including too much of the surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
