It seems to be correctly placed around the crane, although the top part of the crane is slightly cut off.\n   - The right bounding box (red) also encloses a maritime crane. It appears to be correctly placed around the crane, although it includes a bit of the surrounding area at the bottom.\n   - Both bounding boxes seem to enclose one single target object each.\n\n2. **Recall**:\n   - There are two maritime cranes in the image, and both are localized by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**:\n   - The left bounding box (purple) is slightly tight at the top, cutting off a small part of the crane.\n   - The right bounding box (red) is slightly loose at the bottom, including a bit of the surrounding area.\n   - Overall, the fit is reasonable and not too harsh.\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Precision\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Recall\": \"Yes\",\n  \"Fit\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
