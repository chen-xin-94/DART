In the image, there are two bounding boxes, each enclosing a single maritime crane. The bounding boxes do not overlap with other objects significantly and seem to be correctly placed around the cranes.\n\n2. **Recall**: All target objects (maritime cranes) should be localized by a bounding box. In the image, there are two maritime cranes, and both are enclosed by bounding boxes.\n\n3. **Fit**: Each bounding box should neither be too loose nor too tight. The bounding boxes appear to be well-fitted around the cranes, not cutting off significant parts of the cranes or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
