Each box contains one crane, and the boxes are reasonably inferred even if parts of the cranes are occluded.\n2. **Recall**: All visible maritime cranes in the image are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are neither too loose nor too tight. They fit well around the cranes, with slight allowances for occlusion and minor external areas.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
