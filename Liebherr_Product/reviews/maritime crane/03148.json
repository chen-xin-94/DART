The crane is well-defined within the box, and the occluded parts are reasonably estimated.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one maritime crane in the image, and it is localized by the bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits the crane well, with only minor parts of the crane slightly cut off, which is acceptable.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
