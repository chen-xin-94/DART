The reachstacker is clearly visible and the bounding box is appropriately placed around it.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one reachstacker in the image, and it is correctly localized by the bounding box. There are no maritime cranes in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the reachstacker, including all relevant parts of the machine.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
