It seems to cover multiple objects, including parts of other machinery and containers.\n2. **Recall**: There is at least one reachstacker in the image, but it is not properly localized by the bounding box. There are no maritime cranes annotated, even though there is a maritime crane visible in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is too loose, covering multiple objects and not accurately fitting the reachstacker.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
