However, it also includes parts of another reachstacker, which affects precision.\n2. **Recall**: There are multiple reachstackers in the image, but only one is annotated. This affects recall as not all target objects are localized by a bounding box.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is slightly loose as it includes parts of another reachstacker and some surrounding area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"No\", \"Recall\":\"No\", \"Fit\":\"No\"}\n```",
