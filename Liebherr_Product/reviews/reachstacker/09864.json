The reachstacker is clearly visible and not occluded.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one reachstacker in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no maritime cranes in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the reachstacker.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
