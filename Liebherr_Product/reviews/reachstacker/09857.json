The reachstacker is clearly visible and well-defined within the box.\n2. Recall: There is only one reachstacker in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no maritime cranes visible in the image.\n3. Fit: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits around the reachstacker, including its extended arm and the container it is lifting.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
