The reachstacker is clearly visible and the bounding box is appropriately sized to include the entire reachstacker.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one reachstacker in the image and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no maritime cranes visible in the image, so recall is satisfied for the reachstacker.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the reachstacker, capturing the entire object without cutting off any parts or including unnecessary background.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
