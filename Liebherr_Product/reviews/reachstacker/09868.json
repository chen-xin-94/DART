There is no occlusion that affects the bounding box's precision.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one reachstacker in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no maritime cranes in the image, so recall is not affected.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It accurately fits the reachstacker without cutting off any significant parts or including too much outside area.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
