The reachstacker is clearly visible and the bounding box is well-placed around it.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one reachstacker in the image and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no maritime cranes in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the reachstacker, covering the entire object without cutting off any significant parts.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
