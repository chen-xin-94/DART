Each box contains one single target object without including other objects.\n2. **Recall**: All visible target objects (maritime cranes) are localized by a bounding box. There are no reachstackers in the image, which is acceptable.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding boxes are well-fitted to the objects. They are neither too loose nor too tight, and they reasonably enclose the entire objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
