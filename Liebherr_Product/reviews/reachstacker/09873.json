The reachstacker is fully within the box, and the box is appropriately sized.\n2. **Recall**: There is only one reachstacker in the image, and it is localized by a bounding box. There are no maritime cranes in the image.\n3. **Fit**: The bounding box is neither too loose nor too tight. It fits well around the reachstacker, capturing the entire object without significant extra space or cutting off parts of the reachstacker.\n\nBased on these observations, the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"Precision\":\"Yes\", \"Recall\":\"Yes\", \"Fit\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
